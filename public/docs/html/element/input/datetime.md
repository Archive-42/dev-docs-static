&lt;input type="datetime"&gt;
=============================

**Deprecated**

This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The HTML `<input type="datetime">` was a control for entering a date and time (hour, minute, second, and fraction of a second) as well as a timezone. **This feature has been [removed from WHATWG HTML](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/336)**, and is no longer supported in browsers.

Instead, browsers are implementing (and developers are encouraged to use) `<input type="datetime-local">`.

The format of the date and time value used by this input type is described in [Format of a valid global date and time string](../../date_and_time_formats#format_of_a_valid_global_date_and_time_string) in [Date and time formats used in HTML](../../date_and_time_formats).
