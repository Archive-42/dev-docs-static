&lt;multicol&gt;: The HTML Multi-Column Layout element
======================================================

**Non-standard**

This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

**Deprecated**

This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The **HTML Multi-Column Layout element** (`<multicol>`) was an experimental element designed to allow multi-column layouts and must not be used. It never got any significant traction and is not implemented in any major browsers. It's covered here only to warn you off in case you stumble on it in any other documentation.

**Do not use this!** In order to implement a multi-column layout, you should be using the regular HTML elements, like [`<div>`](div) in conjunction with [CSS columns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns).
