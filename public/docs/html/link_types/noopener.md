Link types: noopener
====================

The `noopener` keyword for the `rel` attribute of the [`<a>`](../element/a), [`<area>`](../element/area), and [`<form>`](../element/form) elements instructs the browser to navigate to the target resource without granting the new browsing context access to the document that opened it â€” by not setting the [`Window.opener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/opener) property on the opened window (it returns `null`).

This is especially useful when opening untrusted links, in order to ensure they cannot tamper with the originating document via the [`Window.opener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/opener) property (see [About rel=noopener](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/) for more details), while still providing the `Referer` HTTP header (unless `noreferrer` is used as well).

Note that when `noopener` is used, nonempty target names other than `_top`, `_self`, and `_parent` are all treated like `_blank` in terms of deciding whether to open a new window/tab.

**Note**

Setting `target="_blank"` on `<a>` elements now implicitly provides the same `rel` behavior as setting `rel="noopener"` which does not set `window.opener`. See [browser compatibility](../element/a#browser_compatibility) for support status.
