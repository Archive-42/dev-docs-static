# ::after (:after)

In CSS, `::after` creates a [pseudo-element](pseudo-elements) that is the last child of the selected element. It is often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the [`content`](content) property. It is inline by default.

    /* Add an arrow after links */
    a::after {
      content: "→";
    }

**Note:** The pseudo-elements generated by `::before` and `::after` are [contained by the element's formatting box](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/generate.html#before-after-content), and thus don't apply to _[replaced elements](replaced_element)_ such as [`<img>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img), or to [`<br>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br) elements.

## Syntax

    /* CSS3 syntax */
    ::after

    /* CSS2 syntax */
    :after

**Note:** CSS3 introduced the `::after` notation (with two colons) to distinguish [pseudo-classes](pseudo-classes) from [pseudo-elements](pseudo-elements). Browsers also accept `:after`, introduced in CSS2.

## Examples

### Simple usage

Let's create two classes: one for boring paragraphs and one for exciting ones. We can use these classes to add pseudo-elements to the end of paragraphs.

#### HTML

    <p class="boring-text">Here is some plain old boring text.</p>
    <p>Here is some normal text that is neither boring nor exciting.</p>
    <p class="exciting-text">Contributing to MDN is easy and fun.</p>

#### CSS

    .exciting-text::after {
      content: " <- EXCITING!";
      color: green;
    }

    .boring-text::after {
      content: " <- BORING";
      color: red;
    }

#### Result

### Decorative example

We can style text or images in the [`content`](content) property almost any way we want.

#### HTML

    <span class="ribbon">Look at the orange box after this text. </span>

#### CSS

    .ribbon {
      background-color: #5BC8F7;
    }

    .ribbon::after {
      content: "This is a fancy orange box.";
      background-color: #FFBA10;
      border-color: black;
      border-style: dotted;
    }

#### Result

### Tooltips

This example uses `::after`, in conjunction with the [`attr()`](<attr()>) CSS expression and a `data-descr` [custom data attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*), to create tooltips. No JavaScript is required!

We can also support keyboard users with this technique, by adding a `tabindex` of `0` to make each `span` keyboard focusable, and using a CSS `:focus` selector. This shows how flexible `::before` and `::after` can be, though for the most accessible experience a semantic disclosure widget created in some other way (such as with [details and summary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) elements) is likely to be more appropriate.

#### HTML

    <p>Here we have some
      <span tabindex="0" data-descr="collection of words and punctuation">text</span> with a few
      <span tabindex="0" data-descr="small popups that appear when hovering">tooltips</span>.
    </p>

#### CSS

    span[data-descr] {
      position: relative;
      text-decoration: underline;
      color: #00F;
      cursor: help;
    }

    span[data-descr]:hover::after,
    span[data-descr]:focus::after {
      content: attr(data-descr);
      position: absolute;
      left: 0;
      top: 24px;
      min-width: 200px;
      border: 1px #aaaaaa solid;
      border-radius: 10px;
      background-color: #ffffcc;
      padding: 12px;
      color: #000000;
      font-size: 14px;
      z-index: 1;
    }
