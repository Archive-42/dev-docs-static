# :-moz-submit-invalid

**Non-standard**

This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

The `:-moz-submit-invalid` CSS [pseudo-class](pseudo-classes) is a [Mozilla extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Mozilla_Extensions) that represents any submit [`<button>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) on forms whose contents aren't valid based on their [validation constraints](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms#constraint_validation).

By default, no style is applied. You can use this pseudo-class to customize the appearance of the submit button when there are invalid form fields.
