# CSS Shapes

**CSS Shapes** describe geometric shapes for use in CSS. For the [Level 1 specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-shapes/), CSS Shapes can be applied to floating elements. The specification defines a number of different ways to define a shape on a floated element, causing wrapping lines to wrap round the shape rather than following the rectangle of the element's box.

## Basic example

The example below shows an image that has been floated left, and the `shape-outside` property applied with a value of `circle(50%)`. This creates a circle shape, and the content wrapping the float now wraps around that shape. This changes the length of the wrapping text's line boxes.

## Reference

### Properties

- [`shape-image-threshold`](shape-image-threshold)
- [`shape-margin`](shape-margin)
- [`shape-outside`](shape-outside)

### Data types
