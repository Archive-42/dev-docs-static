The `:target-within` [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-class](pseudo-classes) represents an element that is a target element or _contains_ an element that is a target. A target element is a unique element with an `id` matching the URL's fragment. In other words, it represents an element that is itself matched by the [`:target`](:target) pseudo-class or has a descendant that is matched by `:target`. (This includes descendants in [shadow trees](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM).)

    /* Selects a <div> when one of its descendants is a target */
    div:target-within {
      background: cyan;
    }
