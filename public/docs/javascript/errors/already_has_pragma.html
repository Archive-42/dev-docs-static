<h1>Warning: -file- is being assigned a //# sourceMappingURL, but already has one</h1> <p>The JavaScript warning "-file- is being assigned a //# sourceMappingURL, but already has one." occurs when a source map has been specified more than once for a given JavaScript source.</p>

<h2 id="what_went_wrong">What went wrong?</h2>
<p>A source map has been specified more than once for a given JavaScript source.</p> <p>JavaScript sources are often combined and minified to make delivering them from the server more efficient. With <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/" rel=" noopener">source maps</a>, the debugger can map the code being executed to the original source files. There are two ways to assign a source map, either by using a comment or by setting a header to the JavaScript file.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h3 id="setting_source_maps">Setting source maps</h3>
<p>Setting a source map by using a comment in the file:</p> <pre data-language="js"><span class="token comment">//# sourceMappingURL=http://example.com/path/to/your/sourcemap.map</span></pre> <p>Or, alternatively, you can set a header to your JavaScript file:</p> <pre data-language="js"><span class="token constant">X</span><span class="token operator">-</span>SourceMap<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token operator">/</span>path<span class="token operator">/</span>to<span class="token operator">/</span>file<span class="token punctuation">.</span>js<span class="token punctuation">.</span>map</pre>
