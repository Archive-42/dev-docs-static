408 Request Timeout
===================

The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) `408 Request Timeout` response status code means that the server would like to shut down this unused connection. It is sent on an idle connection by some servers, *even without any previous request by the client*.

A server should send the "close" [`Connection`](../headers/connection) header field in the response, since `408` implies that the server has decided to close the connection rather than continue waiting.

This response is used much more since some browsers, like Chrome, Firefox 27+, and IE9, use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms to speed up surfing.

**Note:** some servers merely shut down the connection without sending this message.
