426 Upgrade Required
====================

The HTTP `426 Upgrade Required` client error response code indicates that the server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol.

The server sends an [`Upgrade`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Upgrade) header with this response to indicate the required protocol(s).
