The HTTP `402 Payment Required` is a nonstandard client error status response code that is reserved for future use.

Sometimes, this code indicates that the request can not be processed until the client makes a payment. Originally it was created to enable digital cash or (micro) payment systems and would indicate that the requested content is not available until the client makes a payment. However, no standard use convention exists and different entities use it in different contexts.
