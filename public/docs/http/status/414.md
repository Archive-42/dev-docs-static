414 URI Too Long
================

The HTTP `414 URI Too Long` response status code indicates that the URI requested by the client is longer than the server is willing to interpret.

There are a few rare conditions when this might occur:

-   when a client has improperly converted a [`POST`](../methods/post) request to a [`GET`](../methods/get) request with long query information,
-   when the client has descended into a loop of redirection (for example, a redirected URI prefix that points to a suffix of itself),
-   or when the server is under attack by a client attempting to exploit potential security holes.
