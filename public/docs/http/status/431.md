431 Request Header Fields Too Large
===================================

The HTTP `431 Request Header Fields Too Large` response status code indicates that the server refuses to process the request because the request’s [HTTP headers](../headers) are too long. The request *may* be resubmitted after reducing the size of the request headers.

431 can be used when the **total size** of request headers is too large, or when a **single** header field is too large. To help those running into this error, indicate which of the two is the problem in the response body — ideally, also include which headers are too large. This lets users attempt to fix the problem, such as by clearing their cookies.

Servers will often produce this status if:

-   The [`Referer`](../headers/referer) URL is too long
-   There are too many [Cookies](../cookies) sent in the request
