Resources and URIs
==================

HTTP allows a browser, or another [user agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/user_agent), to communicate with different *resources* on the Internet: to do this the browser needs both the *identity* and the *location* of the resources. These two bits of information are described by a [URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/URI).

[Separating identity and location of a resource: the Alt-Svc header](basics_of_http/separating_identity_and_location_of_a_resource)  
Even if identity and location are both described using a [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL), they are two different concepts and it is useful sometimes to distinguished between them. This article introduces the [`Alt-Svc`](headers/alt-svc) header.
