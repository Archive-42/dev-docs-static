Errors: CORSDisabled
====================

Reason
------

    Reason: CORS disabled

What went wrong?
----------------

A request that needs to use [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS) was attempted, but CORS is disabled in the user's browser. When this happens, the user needs to turn CORS back on in their browser.

In Firefox, the preference that disables CORS is `content.cors.disable`. Setting this to `true` disables CORS, so whenever that's the case, CORS requests will always fail with this error.
