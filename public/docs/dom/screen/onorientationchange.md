Screen.onorientationchange
==========================

**Deprecated**

This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

**Warning:** This is a non-standard deprecated feature which was implemented only in Firefox under a different name. Use [`ScreenOrientation.onchange`](../screenorientation/onchange) instead.

An event handler for the [`orientationchange`](../window/orientationchange_event) events sent to the screen object.
