# Element: afterscriptexecute event

**Non-standard**

This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

This event was a proposal in an early version of the specification. Do not rely on it.

The `afterscriptexecute` event is fired after a script has been executed.

It is a proprietary event specific to Gecko (Firefox).
