RTCIceCandidatePairStats.requestsReceived
=========================================

The [`RTCIceCandidatePairStats`](../rtcicecandidatepairstats) dictionary's `requestsReceived` property indicates the total number of [STUN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/STUN) connectivity check requests that have been received so far on the connection described by this pairing of candidates.

Syntax
------

    requestsReceived = rtcIceCandidatePairStats.requestsReceived;

### Value

An integer value which specifies the number of STUN connectivity and/or consent requests that have been received to date on the connection described by this pair of [ICE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE) candidates.

Because there's no way to tell the difference between requests made to check connectivity and requests made to check consent, the returned figure includes both.

**Note:** The reported number of requests includes retransmissions. If a request had to be repeated due to network issues, it will be counted multiple times here. This differs from [`requestsSent`](requestssent), which *does not* include retransmisions.
