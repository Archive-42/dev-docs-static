# RTCIceCandidatePairStats.requestsSent

The [`RTCIceCandidatePairStats`](../rtcicecandidatepairstats) dictionary's `requestsSent` property indicates the total number of [STUN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/STUN) connectivity check requests that have been sent so far on the connection described by this pair of candidates.

## Syntax

    requestsSent = rtcIceCandidatePairStats.requestsSent;

### Value

An integer value which specifies the number of STUN connectivity requests that have been sent to date on the connection described by this pair of [ICE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE) candidates.

**Note:** The reported number of requests _does not_ include retransmissions. If a request had to be repeated due to network issues, it will be counted multiple times here. This differs from [`requestsReceived`](requestsreceived), which _does_ include retransmisions.
