MSRangeCollection
=================

**Non-standard**

This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

The `MSRangeCollection` object is an array of one or more Range objects.

### Remarks

The MSRangeCollection object does not inherit from any class or interface and does not define any members.
