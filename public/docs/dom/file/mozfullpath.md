# File.mozFullPath

This page is not complete.

**Non-standard**

This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

A privileged extension to the [`File`](../file) interface, the `mozFullPath` property contains the full pathname of the represented file. This property is only available from within browser code or old-style XPCOM-based Firefox extensions. It is not available to web content.
