VRDisplay.depthNear
===================

**Deprecated**

This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The `depthNear` property of the [`VRDisplay`](../vrdisplay) interface gets and sets the z-depth defining the near plane of the [eye view frustum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewing_frustum), i.e. the nearest viewable boundary of the scene.

Generally you should leave the value as is, but you might want to increase it if you are trying to improve performance on slower computers, and/or your UI makes sense with the near boundary made further away.

Syntax
------

    var mydepthNear = vrDisplayInstance.depthNear;

    vrDisplayInstance.depthNear = 1.0;

### Value

A double, representing the z-depth in meters; its initial value is `0.01`.

Examples
--------

    var vrDisplay;

    navigator.getVRDisplays().then(function(displays) {
      vrDisplay = displays[0];
      vrDisplay.depthNear = 1.0;
      vrDisplay.depthFar = 7500.0;
    });
