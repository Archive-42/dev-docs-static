The `deviceMemory` read-only property of the [`Navigator`](../navigator) interface returns the approximate amount of device memory in gigabytes.

The reported value is imprecise to curtail fingerprinting. Itâ€™s approximated by rounding down to the nearest power of 2, then dividing that number by 1024. It is then clamped within lower and upper bounds to protect the privacy of owners of very low- or high-memory devices.

## Syntax

    memoryAmount = navigator.deviceMemory

### Value

A floating point number; one of `0.25`, `0.5`, `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`.

## Example

    const memory = navigator.deviceMemory
    console.log (`This device has at least ${memory}GiB of RAM.`)
