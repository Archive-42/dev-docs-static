PerformancePaintTiming
======================

The `PerformancePaintTiming` interface of the [Paint Timing API](paint_timing_api) provides timing information about "paint" (also called "render") operations during web page construction. "Paint" refers to conversion of the render tree to on-screen pixels.

An application can register a [`PerformanceObserver`](performanceobserver) for "`paint`" [`performance entry types`](performanceentry) and the observer can retrieve the times that paint events occur. Use this information to help identify areas that take too long to provide a good user experience.

Properties
----------

This interface has no properties but it extends the following [`PerformanceEntry`](performanceentry) properties (for "`paint`" [`performance entry types`](performanceentry/entrytype)) by qualifying and constraining the properties as follows:

[`PerformanceEntry.entryType`](performanceentry/entrytype)  
Returns "`paint`".

[`PerformanceEntry.name`](performanceentry/name)  
Returns either `"first-paint"` or `"first-contentful-paint"`.

[`PerformanceEntry.startTime`](performanceentry/starttime)  
Returns the [`timestamp`](domhighrestimestamp) when the paint occurred.

[`PerformanceEntry.duration`](performanceentry/duration)  
Returns 0.

Methods
-------

This interface has no methods.

Example
-------

    function showPaintTimings() {
      if (window.performance) {
        let performance = window.performance;
        let performanceEntries = performance.getEntriesByType('paint');
        performanceEntries.forEach( (performanceEntry, i, entries) => {
          console.log("The time to " + performanceEntry.name + " was " + performanceEntry.startTime + " milliseconds.");
        });
      } else {
        console.log('Performance timing isn\'t supported.');
      }
    }

The code above produces console output something like the following:

    The time to first-paint was 2785.915 milliseconds.
    The time to first-contentful-paint was 2787.460 milliseconds.
