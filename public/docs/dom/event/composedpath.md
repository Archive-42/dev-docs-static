# Event.composedPath()

The `composedPath()` method of the [`Event`](../event) interface returns the eventâ€™s path which is an array of the objects on which listeners will be invoked. This does not include nodes in shadow trees if the shadow root was created with its [`ShadowRoot.mode`](../shadowroot/mode) closed.

## Syntax

    var composed = Event.composedPath();

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

An array of [`EventTarget`](../eventtarget) objects representing the objects on which an event listener will be invoked.

## Examples

In our composed-composed-path example (see it live), we define two trivial custom elements, `<open-shadow>` and `<closed-shadow>`, both of which take the contents of their text attribute and insert them into the element's shadow DOM as the text content of a `<p>` element. The only difference between the two is that their shadow roots are attached with their modes set to `open` and `closed` respectively.

The first definition looks like this, for example:

    customElements.define('open-shadow',
      class extends HTMLElement {
        constructor() {
          super();

          let pElem = document.createElement('p');
          pElem.textContent = this.getAttribute('text');

          let shadowRoot = this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'})
            .appendChild(pElem);

      }
    });

We then insert one of each element into our page:

    <open-shadow text="I have an open shadow root"></open-shadow>
    <closed-shadow text="I have a closed shadow root"></closed-shadow>

Then include a click event listener on the `<html>` element:

    document.querySelector('html').addEventListener('click',function(e) {
      console.log(e.composed);
      console.log(e.composedPath());
    });

When you click on the `<open-shadow>` element and then the `<closed-shadow>` element, you'll notice two things. First, the `composed` property returns `true` because the `click` event is always able to propagate across shadow boundaries. Second, you'll notice a difference in the value of `composedPath` for the two elements. The `<open-shadow>` element's composed path is this:

    Array [ p, ShadowRoot, open-shadow, body, html, HTMLDocument https://mdn.github.io/web-components-examples/composed-composed-path/, Window ]

Whereas the `<closed-shadow>` element's composed path is a follows:

    Array [ closed-shadow, body, html, HTMLDocument https://mdn.github.io/web-components-examples/composed-composed-path/, Window ]

In the second case, the event listeners only propagate as far as the `<closed-shadow>` element itself, but not to the nodes inside the shadow boundary.
