<div class="notecard warning"> <strong id="non-standard">Non-standard</strong> <p>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.</p> </div> <div class="warning notecard"> <p>Obsolete since Gecko 22</p> </div> <p><strong>This Gecko-only feature was removed in Firefox/Gecko 22.</strong> Please use <a href="../server-sent_events">Server-Sent Events</a>, <a href="../websockets_api">Web Sockets</a>, or <code>responseText</code> from progress events instead.</p> <p>This boolean indicates if the response is expected to be a stream of possibly multiple XML documents. If set to <code>true</code>, the content type of the initial response must be <code>multipart/x-mixed-replace</code> or an error will occur. All requests must be asynchronous.</p> <p>This enables support for server push; for each XML document that's written to this request, a new XML DOM document is created and the <code>onload</code> handler is called between documents.</p> <div class="note notecard"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> When this is set, the <code>onload</code> handler and other event handlers are not reset after the first XMLdocument is loaded, and the <code>onload</code> handler is called after each part of the response is received.</p> </div>
