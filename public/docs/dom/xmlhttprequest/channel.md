XMLHttpRequest.channel
======================

**Draft**

This page is not complete.

XMLHttpRequest.channel is an `nsIChannel` that used by the object when performing the request. This is `null` if the channel hasn't been created yet. In the case of a multi-part request, this is the initial channel, not the different parts in the multi-part request. **Requires elevated privileges to access.**
