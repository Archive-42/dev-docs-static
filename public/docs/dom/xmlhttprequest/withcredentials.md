XMLHttpRequest.withCredentials
==============================

The `XMLHttpRequest.withCredentials` property is a [`Boolean`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean) that indicates whether or not cross-site `Access-Control` requests should be made using credentials such as cookies, authorization headers or TLS client certificates. Setting `withCredentials` has no effect on same-site requests.

In addition, this flag is also used to indicate when cookies are to be ignored in the response. The default is `false`. `XMLHttpRequest` from a different domain cannot set cookie values for their own domain unless `withCredentials` is set to `true` before making the request. The third-party cookies obtained by setting `withCredentials` to true will still honor same-origin policy and hence can not be accessed by the requesting script through [document.cookie](../document/cookie) or from response headers.

**Note:** This never affects same-site requests.

**Note:** `XMLHttpRequest` responses from a different domain *cannot* set cookie values for their own domain unless `withCredentials` is set to `true` before making the request, regardless of `Access-Control-` header values.

Example
-------

    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('GET', 'http://example.com/', true);
    xhr.withCredentials = true;
    xhr.send(null);

Starting with Firefox 11, it's no longer supported to use the `withCredentials` attribute when performing synchronous requests. Attempting to do so throws an `NS_ERROR_DOM_INVALID_ACCESS_ERR` exception.

Internet Explorer versions 8 and 9 supported cross-domain requests (CORS) using [`XDomainRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XDomainRequest).
