# MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.volume

**Deprecated**

This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The [`MediaTrackSupportedConstraints`](../mediatracksupportedconstraints) dictionary's `volume` property is a read-only Boolean value which is present (and set to `true`) in the object returned by [`MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()`](../mediadevices/getsupportedconstraints) if and only if the [user agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) supports the `volume` constraint. If the constraint isn't supported, it's not included in the list, so this value will never be `false`.

You can access the supported constraints dictionary by calling `navigator.mediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()`.

## Syntax

    volumeConstraintSupported = supportedConstraintsDictionary.volume;

### Value

This property is present in the dictionary (and its value is always `true`) if the user agent supports the `volume` constraint. If the property isn't present, this property is missing from the supported constraints dictionary, and you'll get [`undefined`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined) if you try to look at its value.

## Example

    let result = document.getElementById("result");

    if (navigator.mediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints().volume) {
      result.textContent = "Supported!";
    } else {
      result.textContent = "Not supported!";
    }
