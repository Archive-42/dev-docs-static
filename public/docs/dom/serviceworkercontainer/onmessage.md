ServiceWorkerContainer.onmessage
================================

**Experimental**

**This is an [experimental technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental)**  
Check the [Browser compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) carefully before using this in production.

The `onmessage` property of the [`ServiceWorkerContainer`](../serviceworkercontainer) interface is an event handler fired whenever a `message` event occurs â€” when incoming messages are received to the [`ServiceWorkerContainer`](../serviceworkercontainer) object (e.g., via a [`Client.postMessage()`](../client/postmessage) call).

**Note:** Messages received from service worker contexts (e.g. as the event object of onmessage) are represented by [`MessageEvent`](../messageevent) objects in modern browsers, for consistency with other web messaging features. (They used to be represented by [`ServiceWorkerMessageEvent`](../serviceworkermessageevent) objects, which have now been deprecated.)

Syntax
------

    serviceWorkerContainer.onmessage = function(messageevent) { ... }

Example
-------

    navigator.serviceWorker.onmessage = function(messageevent) {
      console.log(`received data: ${messageevent.data}`);
    }
