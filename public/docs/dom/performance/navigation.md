Performance.navigation
======================

**Deprecated**

This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

This property is deprecated in the [Navigation Timing Level 2 specification](https://w3c.github.io/navigation-timing/#obsolete).

The legacy `Performance``.navigation` read-only property returns a [`PerformanceNavigation`](../performancenavigation) object representing the type of navigation that occurs in the given browsing context, such as the number of redirections needed to fetch the resource.

This property is not available in workers.
