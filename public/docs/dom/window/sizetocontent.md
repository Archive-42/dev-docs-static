Window.sizeToContent()
======================

**Non-standard**

This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

The `Window.sizeToContent()` method sizes the window according to its content. In order for it to work, the DOM content should be loaded when this function is calledâ€”for example, once the `DOMContentLoaded` event has been thrown.

Since Firefox 20, the mimimal size of the window is clamped to prevent the window from being too small for the user to interact with.
