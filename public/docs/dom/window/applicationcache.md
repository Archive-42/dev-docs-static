Window.applicationCache
=======================

**Deprecated**

This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

**Non-standard**

This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

**Important**

Application Cache is deprecated as of Firefox 44, and is no longer available in insecure contexts from Firefox 60 onwards ([bug 1354175](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1354175), currently Nightly/Beta only). Don't use it to offline websites â€” consider using [service workers](../service_worker_api) instead.
