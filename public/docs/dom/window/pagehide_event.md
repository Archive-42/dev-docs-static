Window: pagehide event
======================

The `pagehide` event is sent to a [`Window`](../window) when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a `pagehide` event before the previous page is shown.

Usage notes
-----------

Like the [`unload`](unload_event) and [`beforeunload`](beforeunload_event) events, this event is not reliably fired by browsers, especially on mobile. For example, the `pagehide` event is not fired at all in the following scenario:

1.  A mobile user visits your page.
2.  The user then switches to a different app.
3.  Later, the user closes the browser from the app manager.

However, unlike the `unload` and `beforeunload` events, this event is compatible with the [back/forward cache](https://web.dev/bfcache/) (bfcache), so adding a listener to this event will not prevent the page from being included in the bfcache.

The best event to use to signal the end of a user's session is the [`visibilitychange`](../document/visibilitychange_event) event. In browsers that don't support `visibilitychange` the `pagehide` event is the next-best alternative.

If you're specifically trying to detect page unload events, the `pagehide` event is the best option.

See the [Page Lifecycle API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/page-lifecycle-api) guide for more information about how this event relates to other events in the page lifecycle.

Examples
--------

In this example, an event handler is established to watch for `pagehide` events and to perform special handling if the page is being persisted for possible reuse.

    window.addEventListener("pagehide", event => {
      if (event.persisted) {
        /* the page isn't being discarded, so it can be reused later */
      }
    }, false);

This can also be written using the <span class="page-not-created">`onpagehide`</span> event handler property on the [`Window`](../window):

    window.onpagehide = event => {
      if (event.persisted) {
        /* the page isn't being discarded, so it can be reused later */
      }
    }
