<h1>FileError</h1>
<div class="notecard deprecated"> <strong id="deprecated">Deprecated</strong> <p>This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the <a href="#browser_compatibility">compatibility table</a> at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.</p> </div> <p>Represents an error that occurs while using the <a href="filereader"><code>FileReader</code></a> interface.</p> <div class="notecard note"> <strong id="note">Note</strong> <p>This interface is obsolete per the latest specification. Use the new DOM4 <a href="domerror"><code>DOMError</code></a> interface instead.</p> </div> <p>In the <a href="file_and_directory_entries_api/introduction">File System API</a>, a <code>FileError</code> represents error conditions that you might encounter while accessing the file system using the asynchronous API. It extends the <code>FileError</code> interface described in <a href="https://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/pub/FileSystem/#bib-FILE-WRITER" rel=" noopener">File Writer</a> and adds several new error codes.</p> <p><code>FileError</code> objects are passed to error callbacks. The objects have a code that shows the type of error that occurred.</p>
<h2 id="best_practices">Best practices</h2>
<p>Most people don't read the page on errors and exceptions unless they're stumped. So the following are a few tips that could help you avoid some pitfalls.</p>
<h3 id="error_callbacks_are_not_optional_for_your_sanity">Error callbacks are not optional for your sanity</h3>
<p>Although error callbacks are optional, you should include them in the arguments of the methods for the sake of the sanity of your users. A web app could fail for various reasons, so you don't want to spend the rest of your day guessing what's going on and going through maddening troubleshooting.</p>
<h3 id="don't_run_your_app_from_file">Don't run your app from file://</h3>
<p>For security reasons, browsers do not allow you to run your app from <code>file://</code>. In fact, many of the powerful storage APIs (such as File System, BlobBuilder, and FileReader) throw errors if you run the app locally from <code>file://</code>. When you're just testing your app, and you don't want to set up a web server, you can bypass the security restriction on Chrome. Just start Chrome with the <code>--allow-file-access-from-files</code> flag. Use the flag only for testing purposes.</p>
