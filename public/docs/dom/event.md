Event
=====

The `Event` interface represents an event which takes place in the DOM.

An event can be triggered by the user action e.g. clicking the mouse button or tapping keyboard, or generated by APIs to represent the progress of an asynchronous task. It can also be triggered programmatically, such as by calling the [`HTMLElement.click()`](htmlelement/click) method of an element, or by defining the event, then sending it to a specified target using [`EventTarget.dispatchEvent()`](eventtarget/dispatchevent).

There are many types of events, some of which use other interfaces based on the main `Event` interface. `Event` itself contains the properties and methods which are common to all events.

Many DOM elements can be set up to accept (or "listen" for) these events, and execute code in response to process (or "handle") them. Event-handlers are usually connected (or "attached") to various [HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) (such as `<button>`, `<div>`, `<span>`, etc.) using [`EventTarget.addEventListener()`](eventtarget/addeventlistener), and this generally replaces using the old HTML [event handler attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes). Further, when properly added, such handlers can also be disconnected if needed using [`removeEventListener()`](eventtarget/removeeventlistener).

**Note:** One element can have several such handlers, even for the exact same event—particularly if separate, independent code modules attach them, each for its own independent purposes. (For example, a webpage with an advertising-module and statistics-module both monitoring video-watching.)

When there are many nested elements, each with its own handler(s), event processing can become very complicated—especially where a parent element receives the very same event as its child elements because "spatially" they overlap so the event technically occurs in both, and the processing order of such events depends on the [Event bubbling and capture](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#event_bubbling_and_capture) settings of each handler triggered.

Constructor
-----------

[`Event()`](event/event)  
Creates an `Event` object, returning it to the caller.

Properties
----------

 [`Event.bubbles`](event/bubbles) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span>   
A boolean indicating whether or not the event bubbles up through the DOM.

[`Event.cancelBubble`](event/cancelbubble)  
A historical alias to [`Event.stopPropagation()`](event/stoppropagation). Setting its value to `true` before returning from an event handler prevents propagation of the event.

 [`Event.cancelable`](event/cancelable) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span>   
A boolean indicating whether the event is cancelable.

 [`Event.composed`](event/composed) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span>   
A boolean indicating whether or not the event can bubble across the boundary between the shadow DOM and the regular DOM.

 [`Event.currentTarget`](event/currenttarget) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span>   
A reference to the currently registered target for the event. This is the object to which the event is currently slated to be sent. It's possible this has been changed along the way through *retargeting*.

 [`Event.deepPath`](event/composedpath) <span class="icon non-standard" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This API has not been standardized. </span>   
An [`Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) of DOM [`Node`](node)s through which the event has bubbled.

 [`Event.defaultPrevented`](event/defaultprevented) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span>   
Indicates whether or not the call to [`event.preventDefault()`](event/preventdefault) canceled the event.

 [`Event.eventPhase`](event/eventphase) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span>   
Indicates which phase of the event flow is being processed.

 [`Event.explicitOriginalTarget`](event/explicitoriginaltarget) <span class="icon non-standard" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This API has not been standardized. </span> <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span>   
The explicit original target of the event (Mozilla-specific.)

 [`Event.originalTarget`](event/originaltarget) <span class="icon non-standard" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This API has not been standardized. </span> <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span>   
The original target of the event, before any retargetings. (Mozilla-specific.)

 [`Event.returnValue`](event/returnvalue) <span class="icon deprecated" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This deprecated API should no longer be used, but will probably still work. </span>   
A historical property introduced by Internet Explorer and eventually adopted into the DOM specification in order to ensure existing sites continue to work. Ideally, you should try to use [`Event.preventDefault()`](event/preventdefault) and [`Event.defaultPrevented`](event/defaultprevented) instead, but you can use `returnValue` if you choose to do so.

 [`Event.srcElement`](event/srcelement) <span class="icon non-standard" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This API has not been standardized. </span>   
A non-standard alias (from old versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer) for [`Event.target`](event/target). Some other browsers are starting to support it for web compatibility purposes.

 [`Event.target`](event/target) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span>   
A reference to the target to which the event was originally dispatched.

 [`Event.timeStamp`](event/timestamp) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span>   
The time at which the event was created (in milliseconds). By specification, this value is time since epoch—but in reality, browsers' definitions vary. In addition, work is underway to change this to be a [`DOMHighResTimeStamp`](domhighrestimestamp) instead.

 [`Event.type`](event/type) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span>   
The name of the event. Case-insensitive.

 [`Event.isTrusted`](event/istrusted) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span>   
Indicates whether or not the event was initiated by the browser (after a user click, for instance) or by a script (using an event creation method, like [`Event.initEvent`](event/initevent)).

### Deprecated properties

 [`Event.scoped`](event/composed) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span> <span class="icon deprecated" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This deprecated API should no longer be used, but will probably still work. </span>   
A [`Boolean`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean) indicating whether the given event will bubble across through the shadow root into the standard DOM. Use [`composed`](event/composed) instead.

Methods
-------

[`Event.composedPath()`](event/composedpath)  
Returns the event’s path (objects on which listeners will be invoked). This does not include nodes in shadow trees if the shadow root was created with its [`ShadowRoot.mode`](shadowroot/mode) closed.

[`Event.preventDefault()`](event/preventdefault)  
Cancels the event (if it is cancelable).

[`Event.stopImmediatePropagation()`](event/stopimmediatepropagation)  
For this particular event, prevent all other listeners from being called. This includes listeners attached to the same element as well as those attached to elements that will be traversed later (during the capture phase, for instance).

[`Event.stopPropagation()`](event/stoppropagation)  
Stops the propagation of events further along in the DOM.

### Deprecated methods

 [`Event.initEvent()`](event/initevent) <span class="icon deprecated" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This deprecated API should no longer be used, but will probably still work. </span>   
Initializes the value of an Event created. If the event has already been dispatched, this method does nothing.

 <span class="page-not-created">`Event.getPreventDefault()`</span> <span class="icon non-standard" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This API has not been standardized. </span> <span class="icon deprecated" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This deprecated API should no longer be used, but will probably still work. </span>   
Returns the value of [`Event.defaultPrevented`](event/defaultprevented).

 <span class="page-not-created">`Event.preventBubble()`</span> <span class="icon non-standard" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This API has not been standardized. </span> <span class="icon deprecated" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This deprecated API should no longer be used, but will probably still work. </span>   
Prevents the event from bubbling. Use [`event.stopPropagation`](event/stoppropagation) instead.

 <span class="page-not-created">`Event.preventCapture()`</span> <span class="icon non-standard" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This API has not been standardized. </span> <span class="icon deprecated" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This deprecated API should no longer be used, but will probably still work. </span>   
Prevents the event from bubbling. Use [`event.stopPropagation`](event/stoppropagation) instead.

On Internet Explorer 6 through 8, the event model is different. Event listeners are attached with the non-standard [`EventTarget.attachEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/attachEvent) method. In this model, there is no equivalent to `event.currentTarget` and `this` is the global object. One solution to emulate the `event.currentTarget` feature is to wrap your handler in a function calling the handler using `Function.prototype.call` with the element as a first argument. This way, `this` will be the expected value.
