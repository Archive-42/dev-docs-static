VRDisplayEvent
==============

**Deprecated**

This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The `VRDisplayEvent` interface of the [WebVR API](webvr_api) represents the event object of WebVR-related events (see the [list of WebVR window extensions](webvr_api#window)).

Constructor
-----------

[`VRDisplayEvent.VRDisplayEvent()`](vrdisplayevent/vrdisplayevent)  
Creates a `VRDisplayEvent` object instance.

Properties
----------

*`VRDisplayEvent` also inherits properties from its parent object, [`Event`](event).*

 [`VRDisplayEvent.display`](vrdisplayevent/display) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span>   
The [`VRDisplay`](vrdisplay) associated with this event.

 [`VRDisplayEvent.reason`](vrdisplayevent/reason) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span>   
A human-readable reason why the event was fired.

Examples
--------

    window.addEventListener('vrdisplaypresentchange', function(e) {
      console.log('Display ' + e.display.displayId + ' presentation has changed. Reason given: ' + e.reason + '.');
    })
