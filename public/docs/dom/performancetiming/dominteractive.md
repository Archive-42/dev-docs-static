PerformanceTiming.domInteractive
================================

**Deprecated**

This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

**Warning**

This interface of this property is deprecated in the [Navigation Timing Level 2 specification](https://w3c.github.io/navigation-timing/#obsolete). Please use the [`PerformanceNavigationTiming`](../performancenavigationtiming) interface instead.

The legacy `PerformanceTiming``.domInteractive` read-only property returns an `unsigned long long` representing the moment, in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch, when the parser finished its work on the main document, that is when its [`Document.readyState`](../document/readystate) changes to `'interactive'` and the corresponding `readystatechange` event is thrown.

This property can be used to measure the speed of loading Web sites that users *feels*. Nevertheless there are a few caveats that happens if scripts are blocking rendering and not loaded asynchronously or with custom Web fonts. [Check if you are in one of these cases](https://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2015/08/07/dominteractive-is-it-really/) before using this property as a proxy for the user experience of a Web site's speed of loading.
