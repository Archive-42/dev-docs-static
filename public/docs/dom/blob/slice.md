# Blob.slice()

The [`Blob`](../blob) interface's `slice()` method creates and returns a new `Blob` object which contains data from a subset of the blob on which it's called.

## Syntax

    var newBlob = blob.slice(start, end, contentType);

### Parameters

`start` <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>  
An index into the [`Blob`](../blob) indicating the first byte to include in the new [`Blob`](../blob). If you specify a negative value, it's treated as an offset from the end of the [`Blob`](../blob) toward the beginning. For example, -10 would be the 10th from last byte in the [`Blob`](../blob). The default value is 0. If you specify a value for `start` that is larger than the size of the source [`Blob`](../blob), the returned [`Blob`](../blob) has size 0 and contains no data.

`end` <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>  
An index into the [`Blob`](../blob) indicating the first byte that will \*not\* be included in the new [`Blob`](../blob) (i.e. the byte exactly at this index is not included). If you specify a negative value, it's treated as an offset from the end of the [`Blob`](../blob) toward the beginning. For example, -10 would be the 10th from last byte in the [`Blob`](../blob). The default value is `size`.

`contentType` <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>  
The content type to assign to the new [`Blob`](../blob); this will be the value of its `type` property. The default value is an empty string.

### Return value

A new [`Blob`](../blob) object containing the specified subset of the data contained within the blob on which this method was called. The original blob is not altered.

Prior to Firefox 12, there was a bug that affected the behavior of `Blob.slice()`; it did not work for `start` and `end` positions outside the range of signed 64-bit values; it has now been fixed to support unsigned 64-bit values.
