# FileEntrySync

**Non-standard**

This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

The `FileEntrySync` interface of the [File System API](file_and_directory_entries_api/introduction) represents a file in a file system. It lets you write content to a file.

Inherits from: [EntrySync](filesystementrysync)

## About this document

This document was last updated on March 2, 2012 and follows the [W3C Specifications (Working Draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/file-system-api/) drafted on April 19, 2011.

This specification is more or less abandoned as it didn't get significant traction among browser makers.

## Basic concepts

To write content to file, create a FileWriter object by calling [`createWriter()`](#createwriter).
