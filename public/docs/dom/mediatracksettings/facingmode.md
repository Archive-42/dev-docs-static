# MediaTrackSettings.facingMode

The [`MediaTrackSettings`](../mediatracksettings) dictionary's `facingMode` property is a [`DOMString`](../domstring) indicating the direction in which the camera producing the video track represented by the [`MediaStreamTrack`](../mediastreamtrack) is currently facing. This lets you determine what value was selected to comply with your specified constraints for this property's value as described in the [`MediaTrackConstraints.facingMode`](../mediatrackconstraints/facingmode) property you provided when calling either [`getUserMedia()`](../mediadevices/getusermedia) or [`MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints()`](../mediastreamtrack/applyconstraints).

If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported by checking the value of [`MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.facingMode`](../mediatracksupportedconstraints/facingmode) as returned by a call to [`MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()`](../mediadevices/getsupportedconstraints). However, typically this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any constraints they're unfamiliar with.

Because [RTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTP) doesn't include this information, tracks associated with a [WebRTC](../webrtc_api) [`RTCPeerConnection`](../rtcpeerconnection) will never include this property.

## Syntax

    var facingMode = MediaTrackSettings.facingMode;

### Value

A [`DOMString`](../domstring) whose value is one of the strings in `VideoFacingModeEnum`.

### VideoFacingModeEnum

The following strings are permitted values for the facing mode. These may represent separate cameras, or they may represent directions in which an adjustable camera can be pointed.

`"user"`  
The video source is facing toward the user; this includes, for example, the front-facing camera on a smartphone.

`"environment"`  
The video source is facing away from the user, thereby viewing their environment. This is the back camera on a smartphone.

`"left"`  
The video source is facing toward the user but to their left, such as a camera aimed toward the user but over their left shoulder.

`"right"`  
The video source is facing toward the user but to their right, such as a camera aimed toward the user but over their right shoulder.

## Example

See [Example: Constraint exerciser](#) in [Capabilities, constraints, and settings](../media_streams_api/constraints) for an example.
