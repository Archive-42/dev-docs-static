# RTCIceCandidate.candidate

The read-only property `candidate` on the [`RTCIceCandidate`](../rtcicecandidate) interface returns a [`DOMString`](../domstring) describing the candidate in detail. Most of the other properties of `RTCIceCandidate` are actually extracted from this string.

This property can be configured by specifying the value of the [`candidate`](../rtcicecandidateinit/candidate) property when constructing the new candidate object using [`RTCIceCandidate()`](rtcicecandidate).

## Syntax

    var candidate = RTCIceCandidate.candidate;

### Value

A [`DOMString`](../domstring) describing the properties of the candidate, taken directly from the [SDP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SDP) attribute `"candidate"`. The candidate string specifies the network connectivity information for the candidate. If the `candidate` is an empty string (`""`), the end of the candidate list has been reached; this candidate is known as the "end-of-candidates" marker.

The syntax of the candidate string is described in [RFC 5245, section 15.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5245#section-15.1). For an a-line (attribute line) that looks like this:

    a=candidate:4234997325 1 udp 2043278322 192.168.0.56 44323 typ host

the corresponding `candidate` string's value will be `"candidate:4234997325 1 udp 2043278322 192.168.0.56 44323 typ host"`.

The [user agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) always prefers candidates with the highest [`priority`](priority), all else being equal. In the example above, the priority is `2043278322`. The attributes are all separated by a single space character, and are in a specific order. The complete list of attributes for this example candidate is:

- [`foundation`](foundation) = 4234997325
- [`component`](component) = `"rtp"` (the number 1 is encoded to this string; 2 becomes `"rtcp"`)
- [`protocol`](protocol) = `"udp"`
- [`priority`](priority) = 2043278322
- [`ip`](address) = `"192.168.0.56"`
- [`port`](port) = 44323
- [`type`](type) = `"host"`

## Example

In this example, we see a function which receives as input an SDP string containing an ICE candidate received from the remote peer during the signaling process.

    function handleNewIceCandidate(candidateSDP) {
      var candidateObj = new RTCIceCandidate(candidateSDP);

      myPeerConnection.addIceCandidate(candidateObj).catch({
        /* handle the error thrown by addIceCandidate() */
      });
    }

The `handleNewIceCandidate()` function shown here passes the received candidate's SDP text into [`RTCIceCandidate()`](rtcicecandidate) to receive an <span class="page-not-created">`RTCIceCanddiate`</span> object in return, which represents the candidate.

The new candidate is then passed into [`RTCPeerConnection.addIceCandidate()`](../rtcpeerconnection/addicecandidate) to add the candidate to the list of candidates for WebRTC to consider using for the connection being established.

This example could be simplified somewhat; you may more often see the code look something like this, taking advantage of more advanced ECMAScript 2016 features:

    let handleNewIceCandidate = candidateSDP =>
      myPeerConnection.addIceCandidate(new RTCIceCandidate(candidateSDP));
