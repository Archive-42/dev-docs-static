<h2 id="value">Value</h2>
<p>Boolean value set to <em>true</em> indicates that low-latency playback will be enabled on the media element. Low-latency playback is useful in communication and some gaming scenarios, but is more demanding on power consumption and less reliable for smooth media playback.</p> <p>You must set the <code>msRealTime</code> before setting the <code>src</code> property in code.</p> <p><code>msRealTime</code> should not be used in non-real-time or non-communication scenarios, such as audio and/or video playback, as this can affects playback startup latency of audio and video playback.</p>
