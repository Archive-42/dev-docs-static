PaymentRequest.onshippingaddresschange
======================================

**Secure context**

This feature is available only in [secure contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts) (HTTPS), in some or all [supporting browsers](#browser_compatibility).

The `onshippingaddresschange` event of the [`PaymentRequest`](../paymentrequest) interface is fired whenever the user changes their shipping address, including when an address is added by the user for the first time.

Syntax
------

    PaymentRequest.addEventListener('shippingaddresschange', shippingAddressChangeEvent => { ... });

    PaymentRequest.onshippingaddresschange = function(shippingAddressChangeEvent) { ... };

Examples
--------

The `shippingaddresschange` event is triggered by a user-agent controlled interaction. If the address stored by the user agent changes at any time during a payment process, the event is triggered. To make sure an updated address is included when sending payment information to the server, you should add event listeners for a [`PaymentRequest`](../paymentrequest) object after instantiation, but before the call to `show()`.

    // Initialization of PaymentRequest arguments are excerpted for clarity.
    var payment = new PaymentRequest(supportedInstruments, details, options);

    request.addEventListener('shippingaddresschange', function(evt) {
      evt.updateWith(new Promise(function(resolve) {
        updateDetails(details, request.shippingAddress, resolve);
      }));
    });

    payment.show().then(function(paymentResponse) {
      // Processing of paymentResponse exerpted for the same of clarity.
    }).catch(function(err) {
      console.error("Uh oh, something bad happened", err.message);
    });
