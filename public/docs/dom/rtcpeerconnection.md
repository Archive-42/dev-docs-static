RTCPeerConnection
=================

Constructor
-----------

The `RTCPeerConnection` interface represents a WebRTC connection between the local computer and a remote peer. It provides methods to connect to a remote peer, maintain and monitor the connection, and close the connection once it's no longer needed.

 [`RTCPeerConnection()`](rtcpeerconnection/rtcpeerconnection) <span class="icon experimental" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This is an experimental API that should not be used in production code. </span>   
The `RTCPeerConnection()` constructor returns a newly-created `RTCPeerConnection`, which represents a connection between the local device and a remote peer.

[`canTrickleIceCandidates`](rtcpeerconnection/cantrickleicecandidates)  
The read-only `RTCPeerConnection` property `canTrickleIceCandidates` returns a `Boolean` which indicates whether or not the remote peer can accept [trickled ICE candidates](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice).

 [`connectionState`](rtcpeerconnection/connectionstate) <span class="icon experimental" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This is an experimental API that should not be used in production code. </span>   
The read-only `connectionState` property of the `RTCPeerConnection` interface indicates the current state of the peer connection by returning one of the string values specified by the enum `RTCPeerConnectionState`.

 [`currentLocalDescription`](rtcpeerconnection/currentlocaldescription) undefined  
The read-only property `RTCPeerConnection.currentLocalDescription` returns an `RTCSessionDescription` object describing the local end of the connection as it was most recently successfully negotiated since the last time the `RTCPeerConnection` finished negotiating and connecting to a remote peer. Also included is a list of any ICE candidates that may already have been generated by the ICE agent since the offer or answer represented by the description was first instantiated.

 [`currentRemoteDescription`](rtcpeerconnection/currentremotedescription) undefined  
The read-only property `RTCPeerConnection.currentRemoteDescription` returns an `RTCSessionDescription` object describing the remote end of the connection as it was most recently successfully negotiated since the last time the `RTCPeerConnection` finished negotiating and connecting to a remote peer. Also included is a list of any ICE candidates that may already have been generated by the ICE agent since the offer or answer represented by the description was first instantiated.

 [`getDefaultIceServers()`](rtcpeerconnection/getdefaulticeservers) <span class="icon experimental" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This is an experimental API that should not be used in production code. </span>   
The `getDefaultIceServers()` method of the `RTCPeerConnection` interface returns an array of objects based on the `RTCIceServer` dictionary, which indicates what, if any, ICE servers the browser will use by default if none are provided to the `RTCPeerConnection` in its `RTCConfiguration`. However, browsers are **not** required to provide any default ICE servers at all.

 [`iceConnectionState`](rtcpeerconnection/iceconnectionstate) undefined  
The read-only property `RTCPeerConnection.iceConnectionState` returns an enum of type `RTCIceConnectionState` which state of the ICE agent associated with the `RTCPeerConnection`.

The read-only property `RTCPeerConnection.iceGatheringState` returns an enum of type `RTCIceGatheringState` that describes connection's ICE gathering state. This lets you detect, for example, when collection of ICE candidates has finished.

 [`localDescription`](rtcpeerconnection/localdescription) <span class="icon experimental" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This is an experimental API that should not be used in production code. </span> undefined  
The read-only property `RTCPeerConnection.localDescription` returns an `RTCSessionDescription` describing the session for the local end of the connection. If it has not yet been set, this is `null`.

 [`peerIdentity`](rtcpeerconnection/peeridentity) undefined  
The read-only `RTCPeerConnection` property `peerIdentity` returns a JavaScript `Promise` that resolves to an `RTCIdentityAssertion` which contains a `DOMString` identifying the remote peer.

 [`pendingLocalDescription`](rtcpeerconnection/pendinglocaldescription) undefined  
The read-only property `RTCPeerConnection.pendingLocalDescription` returns an `RTCSessionDescription` object describing a pending configuration change for the local end of the connection. This does not describe the connection as it currently stands, but as it may exist in the near future. Use `RTCPeerConnection.currentLocalDescription` or `RTCPeerConnection.localDescription` to get the current state of the endpoint. For details on the difference, see `/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Connectivity`.

 [`pendingRemoteDescription`](rtcpeerconnection/pendingremotedescription) undefined  
The read-only property `RTCPeerConnection.pendingRemoteDescription` returns an `RTCSessionDescription` object describing a pending configuration change for the remote end of the connection. This does not describe the connection as it currently stands, but as it may exist in the near future. Use `RTCPeerConnection.currentRemoteDescription` or `RTCPeerConnection.remoteDescription` to get the current session description for the remote endpoint. For details on the difference, see `/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Connectivity`.

 [`remoteDescription`](rtcpeerconnection/remotedescription) <span class="icon experimental" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This is an experimental API that should not be used in production code. </span> undefined  
The read-only property `RTCPeerConnection.remoteDescription` returns a `RTCSessionDescription` describing the session (which includes configuration and media information) for the remote end of the connection. If this hasn't been set yet, this is `null`.

The read-only `sctp` property on the `RTCPeerConnection` interface returns an `RTCSctpTransport` describing the SCTP transport over which SCTP data is being sent and received. If SCTP hasn't been negotiated, this value is `null`.

 [`signalingState`](rtcpeerconnection/signalingstate) undefined  
The read-only `signalingState` property on the `RTCPeerConnection` interface returns one of the string values specified by the `RTCSignalingState` enum; these values describe the state of the signaling process on the local end of the connection while connecting or reconnecting to another peer. See `/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Session_lifetime` for more details about the signaling process.

 [`onaddstream`](rtcpeerconnection/onaddstream) <span class="icon deprecated" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This deprecated API should no longer be used, but will probably still work. </span>   
The `RTCPeerConnection.onaddstream` event handler is a property containing the code to execute when the `addstream` event, of type `MediaStreamEvent`, is received by this `RTCPeerConnection`. Such an event is sent when a `MediaStream` is added to this connection by the remote peer. The event is sent immediately after the call `RTCPeerConnection.setRemoteDescription` and doesn't wait for the result of the SDP negotiation.

[`onconnectionstatechange`](rtcpeerconnection/onconnectionstatechange)  
The `RTCPeerConnection.onconnectionstatechange` property specifies an `EventHandler` which is called to handle the `connectionstatechange` event when it occurs on an instance of `RTCPeerConnection`. This happens whenever the aggregate state of the connection changes.

The `RTCPeerConnection` interface's `onnegotiationneeded` property is an `EventListener` which specifies a function which is called to handle the `negotiationneeded` event when it occurs on an `RTCPeerConnection` instance. This event is fired when a change has occurred which requires session negotiation. This negotiation should be carried out as the offerer, because some session changes cannot be negotiated as the answerer.

 <s>[`onpeeridentity`](rtcpeerconnection/onpeeridentity)</s> <span class="icon obsolete" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This is an obsolete API and is no longer guaranteed to work. </span>   
The `RTCPeerConnection.onpeeridentity` event handler is a property containing the code to execute whent the `peeridentity` event, of type `Event`, is received by this `RTCPeerConnection`. Such an event is sent when an identity assertion, received from a peer, has been successfully validated.

 [`onremovestream`](rtcpeerconnection/onremovestream) <span class="icon experimental" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This is an experimental API that should not be used in production code. </span>   
The `removestream` event has been removed from the WebRTC specification in favor of the existing `removetrack` event on the remote `MediaStream` and the corresponding `MediaStream.onremovetrack` event handler property of the remote `MediaStream`. The `RTCPeerConnection` API is now track-based, so having zero tracks in the remote stream is equivalent to the remote stream being removed and the old removestream event.

[`onsignalingstatechange`](rtcpeerconnection/onsignalingstatechange)  
The `onsignalingstatechange` event handler property of the `RTCPeerConnection` interface specifies a function to be called when the `signalingstatechange` event occurs on an `RTCPeerConnection` interface.

The `RTCPeerConnection` property `ontrack` is an `EventHandler` which specifies a function to be called when the `track` event occurs, indicating that a track has been added to the `RTCPeerConnection`.

[`addIceCandidate()`](rtcpeerconnection/addicecandidate)  
When a web site or app using `RTCPeerConnection` receives a new ICE candidate from the remote peer over its signaling channel, it delivers the newly-received candidate to the browser's ICE agent by calling `RTCPeerConnection.addIceCandidate()`.

 [`addStream()`](rtcpeerconnection/addstream) <span class="icon experimental" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This is an experimental API that should not be used in production code. </span> <span class="icon deprecated" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This deprecated API should no longer be used, but will probably still work. </span>   
The *obsolete* `RTCPeerConnection` method `addStream()` adds a `MediaStream` as a local source of audio or video. Instead of using this obsolete method, you should instead use `RTCPeerConnection.addTrack` once for each track you wish to send to the remote peer.

[`addTrack()`](rtcpeerconnection/addtrack)  
The `RTCPeerConnection` method `addTrack()` adds a new media track to the set of tracks which will be transmitted to the other peer.

 [`close()`](rtcpeerconnection/close) <span class="icon experimental" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This is an experimental API that should not be used in production code. </span>

 [`createAnswer()`](rtcpeerconnection/createanswer) <span class="icon experimental" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This is an experimental API that should not be used in production code. </span>   
The `createAnswer()` method on the `RTCPeerConnection` interface creates an SDP answer to an offer received from a remote peer during the offer/answer negotiation of a WebRTC connection. The answer contains information about any media already attached to the session, codecs and options supported by the browser, and any ICE candidates already gathered. The answer is delivered to the returned `Promise`, and should then be sent to the source of the offer to continue the negotiation process.

 [`createDataChannel()`](rtcpeerconnection/createdatachannel) <span class="icon experimental" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This is an experimental API that should not be used in production code. </span>   
The `createDataChannel()` method on the `RTCPeerConnection` interface creates a new channel linked with the remote peer, over which any kind of data may be transmitted.

[`createOffer()`](rtcpeerconnection/createoffer)  
The `createOffer()` method of the `RTCPeerConnection` interface initiates the creation of an SDP offer for the purpose of starting a new WebRTC connection to a remote peer.

[`generateCertificate() static function`](rtcpeerconnection/generatecertificate)  
The static `RTCPeerConnection.generateCertificate()` function creates an X.509 certificate and corresponding private key, returning a promise that resolves with the new `RTCCertificate` once it's generated.

 [`getConfiguration()`](rtcpeerconnection/getconfiguration) <span class="icon experimental" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This is an experimental API that should not be used in production code. </span>

The `RTCPeerConnection.getIdentityAssertion()` method initiates the gathering of an identity assertion. This has an effect only if the `RTCPeerConnection.signalingState` is not `"closed"`.

 [`getReceivers()`](rtcpeerconnection/getreceivers) <span class="icon experimental" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This is an experimental API that should not be used in production code. </span>   
The `RTCPeerConnection.getReceivers()` method returns an array of `RTCRtpReceiver` objects, each of which represents one RTP receiver. Each RTP receiver manages the reception and decoding of data for a `MediaStreamTrack` on an `RTCPeerConnection`

[`getSenders()`](rtcpeerconnection/getsenders)  
The `RTCPeerConnection` method `getSenders()` returns an array of `RTCRtpSender` objects, each of which represents the RTP sender responsible for transmitting one track's data.

The `RTCPeerConnection.getStreamById()` method returns the [`MediaStream`](mediastream) with the given id that is associated with local or remote end of the connection. If no stream matches, it returns `null`.

[`getTransceivers()`](rtcpeerconnection/gettransceivers)  
The `RTCPeerConnection` interface's `getTransceivers()` method returns a list of the `RTCRtpTransceiver` objects being used to send and receive data on the connection.

 [`removeStream()`](rtcpeerconnection/removestream) <span class="icon experimental" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This is an experimental API that should not be used in production code. </span> <span class="icon deprecated" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This deprecated API should no longer be used, but will probably still work. </span>   
The `RTCPeerConnection.removeStream()` method removes a `MediaStream` as a local source of audio or video. If the negotiation already happened, a new one will be needed for the remote peer to be able to use it. Because this method has been deprecated, you should instead use `RTCPeerConnection.removeTrack` if your target browser versions have implemented it.

[`removeTrack()`](rtcpeerconnection/removetrack)  
The `RTCPeerConnection.removeTrack()` method tells the local end of the connection to stop sending media from the specified track, without actually removing the corresponding `RTCRtpSender` from the list of senders as reported by `RTCPeerConnection.getSenders()`.

[`restartIce()`](rtcpeerconnection/restartice)  
The [WebRTC](webrtc_api) API's `RTCPeerConnection` interface offers the `restartIce()` method to allow a web application to easily request that ICE candidate gathering be redone on both ends of the connection.

 [`setConfiguration()`](rtcpeerconnection/setconfiguration) <span class="icon experimental" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This is an experimental API that should not be used in production code. </span>   
The `RTCPeerConnection.setConfiguration()` method sets the current configuration of the `RTCPeerConnection` based on the values included in the specified `RTCConfiguration` object. This lets you change the ICE servers used by the connection and which transport policies to use.

 [`setIdentityProvider()`](rtcpeerconnection/setidentityprovider) <span class="icon experimental" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This is an experimental API that should not be used in production code. </span>   
The `RTCPeerConnection.setIdentityProvider()` method sets the Identity Provider (IdP) to the triplet given in parameter: its name, the protocol used to communicate with it (optional) and an optional username. The IdP will be used only when an assertion is needed.

[`setLocalDescription()`](rtcpeerconnection/setlocaldescription)  
The `RTCPeerConnection` method `RTCPeerConnection.setLocalDescription` changes the local description associated with the connection. This description specifies the properties of the local end of the connection, including the media format.

[`setRemoteDescription()`](rtcpeerconnection/setremotedescription)  
The `RTCPeerConnection` method `setRemoteDescription()` sets the specified session description as the remote peer's current offer or answer. The description specifies the properties of the remote end of the connection, including the media format.

### Obsolete method

The following method was obsoleted long ago and was never implemented in all major browsers.

 <span class="page-not-created">`RTCPeerConnection.createDTMFSender()`</span> <span class="icon deprecated" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This deprecated API should no longer be used, but will probably still work. </span>   
Creates a new [`RTCDTMFSender`](rtcdtmfsender), associated to a specific [`MediaStreamTrack`](mediastreamtrack), that will be able to send [DTMF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DTMF) phone signaling over the connection.

 [`removestream`](rtcpeerconnection/removestream_event) <span class="icon deprecated" viewbox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img"> This deprecated API should no longer be used, but will probably still work. </span>   
Sent to the `RTCPeerConnection` when a [`MediaStream`](mediastream) is removed from the connection. Instead of watching for this obsolete event, you should watch each stream for [`removetrack`](mediastream/removetrack_event) events on each stream within the `RTCPeerConnection`.  
Also available as the [`onaddstream`](rtcpeerconnection/onremovestream) event handler property.

Constants
---------

### RTCBundlePolicy enum

The `RTCBundlePolicy` enum defines string constants which are used to request a specific policy for gathering ICE candidates if the remote peer isn't "BUNDLE-aware" (compatible with the [SDP BUNDLE standard](https://webrtcstandards.info/sdp-bundle/) for bundling multiple media streams on a single transport link). All browser implementations are BUNDLE-aware.

If the remote endpoint is BUNDLE-aware, all media tracks and data channels are bundled onto a single transport at the completion of negotiation, regardless of policy used, and any superfluous transports that were created initially are closed at that point.

**Note:** In technical terms, a BUNDLE lets all media flow between two peers flow across a single **5-tuple**; that is, from a single IP and port on one peer to a single IP and port on the other peer, using the same transport protocol.

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><code>"balanced"</code></td><td>The ICE agent initially creates one <a href="rtcdtlstransport"><code>RTCDtlsTransport</code></a> for each type of content added: audio, video, and data channels. If the remote endpoint is not BUNDLE-aware, then each of these DTLS transports then handles all the communication for one type of data.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>"max-compat"</code></td><td>The ICE agent initially creates one <a href="rtcdtlstransport"><code>RTCDtlsTransport</code></a> per media track and a separate one for data channels. If the remote endpoint is not BUNDLE-aware, everything is negotiated on these separate DTLS transports.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>"max-bundle"</code></td><td>The ICE agent initially creates only a single <a href="rtcdtlstransport"><code>RTCDtlsTransport</code></a> to carry all of the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>'s data. If the remote endpoint is not BUNDLE-aware, then only a single track will be negotiated and the rest ignored.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### RTCIceConnectionState enum

The `RTCIceConnectionState` enum defines the string constants used to describe the current state of the ICE agent and its connection to the ICE server (that is, the [STUN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/STUN) or [TURN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TURN) server).

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><code>"new"</code></td><td>The ICE agent is gathering addresses or is waiting to be given remote candidates through calls to <a href="rtcpeerconnection/addicecandidate"><code>RTCPeerConnection.addIceCandidate()</code></a> (or both).</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>"checking"</code></td><td>The ICE agent has been given one or more remote candidates and is checking pairs of local and remote candidates against one another to try to find a compatible match, but has not yet found a pair which will allow the peer connection to be made. It's possible that gathering of candidates is also still underway.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>"connected"</code></td><td>A usable pairing of local and remote candidates has been found for all components of the connection, and the connection has been established. It's possible that gathering is still underway, and it's also possible that the ICE agent is still checking candidates against one another looking for a better connection to use.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>"completed"</code></td><td>The ICE agent has finished gathering candidates, has checked all pairs against one another, and has found a connection for all components.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>"failed"</code></td><td>The ICE candidate has checked all candidates pairs against one another and has failed to find compatible matches for all components of the connection. It is, however, possible that the ICE agent did find compatible connections for some components.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>"disconnected"</code></td><td>Checks to ensure that components are still connected failed for at least one component of the <a href="rtcpeerconnection"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a>. This is a less stringent test than <code>"failed"</code> and may trigger intermittently and resolve just as spontaneously on less reliable networks, or during temporary disconnections. When the problem resolves, the connection may return to the <code>"connected"</code> state.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>"closed"</code></td><td>The ICE agent for this <a href="rtcpeerconnection"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a> has shut down and is no longer handling requests.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### RTCIceGatheringState enum

The `RTCIceGatheringState` enum defines string constants which reflect the current status of ICE gathering, as returned using the [`RTCPeerConnection.iceGatheringState`](rtcpeerconnection/icegatheringstate) property. You can detect when this value changes by watching for an event of type `icegatheringstatechange`.

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><code>"new"</code></td><td>The peer connection was just created and hasn't done any networking yet.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>"gathering"</code></td><td>The ICE agent is in the process of gathering candidates for the connection.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>"complete"</code></td><td>The ICE agent has finished gathering candidates. If something happens that requires collecting new candidates, such as a new interface being added or the addition of a new ICE server, the state will revert to "gathering" to gather those candidates.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### RTCIceTransportPolicy enum

The `RTCIceTransportPolicy` enum defines string constants which can be used to limit the transport policies of the ICE candidates to be considered during the connection process.

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><code>"all"</code></td><td>All ICE candidates will be considered.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>"public" </code><span class="icon deprecated" data-viewbox="0 0 100 100" data-xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-role="img"> This deprecated API should no longer be used, but will probably still work. </span></td><td>Only ICE candidates with public IP addresses will be considered. <em>Removed from the specification's May 13, 2016 working draft.</em></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>"relay"</code></td><td>Only ICE candidates whose IP addresses are being relayed, such as those being passed through a TURN server, will be considered.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### RTCPeerConnectionState enum

The `RTCPeerConnectionState` enum defines string constants which describe states in which the `RTCPeerConnection` may be. These values are returned by the [`connectionState`](rtcpeerconnection/connectionstate) property. This state essentially represents the aggregate state of all ICE transports (which are of type [`RTCIceTransport`](rtcicetransport) or [`RTCDtlsTransport`](rtcdtlstransport)) being used by the connection.

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 50%" /><col style="width: 50%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><code>"new"</code></td><td>At least one of the connection's ICE transports (<a href="rtcicetransport"><code>RTCIceTransport</code></a>s or <a href="rtcdtlstransport"><code>RTCDtlsTransport</code></a>s) are in the <code>"new"</code> state, and none of them are in one of the following states: <code>"connecting"</code>, <code>"checking"</code>, <code>"failed"</code>, or <code>"disconnected"</code>, <em>or</em> all of the connection's transports are in the <code>"closed"</code> state.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>"connecting"</code></td><td>One or more of the ICE transports are currently in the process of establishing a connection; that is, their <code>RTCIceConnectionState</code> is either <code>"checking"</code> or <code>"connected"</code>, and no transports are in the <code>"failed"</code> state. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt; Make this a link once I know where that will be documented</strong></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>"connected"</code></td><td>Every ICE transport used by the connection is either in use (state <code>"connected"</code> or <code>"completed"</code>) or is closed (state <code>"closed"</code>); in addition, at least one transport is either <code>"connected"</code> or <code>"completed"</code>.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>"disconnected"</code></td><td>At least one of the ICE transports for the connection is in the <code>"disconnected"</code> state and none of the other transports are in the state <code>"failed"</code>, <code>"connecting"</code>, or <code>"checking"</code>.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>"failed"</code></td><td>One or more of the ICE transports on the connection is in the <code>"failed"</code> state.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>"closed"</code></td><td><p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> is closed.</p><p>This value was in the <a href="#rtcsignalingstate_enum"><code>RTCSignalingState</code> enum</a> (and therefore found by reading the value of the <a href="rtcpeerconnection/signalingstate"><code>signalingState</code></a>) property until the May 13, 2016 draft of the specification.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

### RTCRtcpMuxPolicy enum

The `RTCRtcpMuxPolicy` enum defines string constants which specify what ICE candidates are gathered to support non-multiplexed RTCP. **&lt;&lt;&lt;add a link to info about multiplexed RTCP.**

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><code>"negotiate"</code></td><td>Instructs the ICE agent to gather both <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTP">RTP</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTCP">RTCP</a> candidates. If the remote peer can multiplex RTCP, then RTCP candidates are multiplexed atop the corresponding RTP candidates. Otherwise, both the RTP and RTCP candidates are returned, separately.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>"require"</code></td><td>Tells the ICE agent to gather ICE candidates for only RTP, and to multiplex RTCP atop them. If the remote peer doesn't support RTCP multiplexing, then session negotiation fails.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### RTCSignalingState enum

The `RTCSignalingState` enum specifies the possible values of [`RTCPeerConnection.signalingState`](rtcpeerconnection/signalingstate), which indicates where in the process of signaling the exchange of offer and answer the connection currently is.

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 50%" /><col style="width: 50%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><code>"stable"</code></td><td>There is no ongoing exchange of offer and answer underway.

This provisional answer describes the supported media formats and so forth, but may not have a complete set of ICE candidates included. Further candidates will be delivered separately later.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>"have-remote-pranswer"</code></td><td>A provisional answer has been received and successfully applied in response to an offer previously sent and established by calling <code>setLocalDescription()</code>.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>"closed"</code> <span class="icon deprecated" data-viewbox="0 0 100 100" data-xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-role="img"> This deprecated API should no longer be used, but will probably still work. </span></td><td><p>The connection is closed.</p><div class="note notecard"><p><strong>Note:</strong> This value moved into the <a href="#rtcpeerconnectionstate_enum"><code>RTCPeerConnectionState</code> enum</a> in the May 13, 2016 draft of the specification, as it reflects the state of the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, not the signaling connection.
