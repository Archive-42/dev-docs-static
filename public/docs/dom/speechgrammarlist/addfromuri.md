SpeechGrammarList.addFromURI()
==============================

**Experimental**

**This is an [experimental technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental)**  
Check the [Browser compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) carefully before using this in production.

The `addFromURI()` method of the [`SpeechGrammarList`](../speechgrammarlist) interface takes a grammar present at a specific URI and adds it to the `SpeechGrammarList` as a new [`SpeechGrammar`](../speechgrammar) object.

Note that some speech recognition services may support built-in grammars that can be specified by URI.

Syntax
------

    speechGrammarListInstance.addFromURI(src,weight);

### Returns

Void.

### Parameters

src  
A [`DOMString`](../domstring) representing the URI of the grammar to be added.

weight <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>   
A float representing the weight of the grammar relative to other grammars present in the [`SpeechGrammarList`](../speechgrammarlist). The weight means the importance of this grammar, or the likelihood that it will be recognized by the speech recognition service. The value can be between `0.0` and `1.0`; If not specified, the default used is `1.0`.

Examples
--------

    var grammar = '#JSGF V1.0; grammar colors; public <color> = aqua | azure | beige | bisque | black | blue | brown | chocolate | coral | crimson | cyan | fuchsia | ghostwhite | gold | goldenrod | gray | green | indigo | ivory | khaki | lavender | lime | linen | magenta | maroon | moccasin | navy | olive | orange | orchid | peru | pink | plum | purple | red | salmon | sienna | silver | snow | tan | teal | thistle | tomato | turquoise | violet | white | yellow ;'
    var recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
    var speechRecognitionList = new SpeechGrammarList();
    speechRecognitionList.addFromString(grammar, 1);
    recognition.grammars = speechRecognitionList;

    speechRecognitionList.addFromURI('http://www.example.com/grammar.txt'); // adds a second grammar to the list.

### Firefox OS permissions

To use speech recognition in an app, you need to specify the following permissions in your [manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Build/Manifest):

    "permissions": {
      "audio-capture" : {
        "description" : "Audio capture"
      },
      "speech-recognition" : {
        "description" : "Speech recognition"
      }
    }

You also need a privileged app, so you need to include this as well:

      "type": "privileged"
