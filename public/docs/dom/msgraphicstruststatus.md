# msGraphicsTrustStatus

**Non-standard**

This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

`msGraphicsTrustStatus` is a read-only property which returns an object containing information on protected video playback.

This proprietary property is specific to Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.

## Syntax

    status = object.msGraphicsTrustStatus;

## Example

        //Specifies the output device id that the audio will be sent to.
        msAudioDeviceType: string;
        readonly msGraphicsTrustStatus: MSGraphicsTrust;
