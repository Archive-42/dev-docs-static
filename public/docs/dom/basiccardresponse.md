# BasicCardResponse

**Secure context**

This feature is available only in [secure contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts) (HTTPS), in some or all [supporting browsers](#browser_compatibility).

**Experimental**

**This is an [experimental technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental)**  
Check the [Browser compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) carefully before using this in production.

The `BasicCardResponse` dictionary (related to the [Payment Request API](payment_request_api), although defined in the [Basic Card Payment spec](#specifications)) defines an object structure for payment response details such as the number/expiry date of the card used to make the payment, and the billing address.

## Properties

[`BasicCardResponse.cardNumber`](basiccardresponse/cardnumber) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span> <span class="notecard inline secure">Secure context</span>  
Contains the number of the card used to make the payment.

[`BasicCardResponse.cardholderName`](basiccardresponse/cardholdername) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span> <span class="notecard inline secure">Secure context</span> <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>  
Contains the cardholder name of the card used to make the payment.

[`BasicCardResponse.cardSecurityCode`](basiccardresponse/cardsecuritycode) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span> <span class="notecard inline secure">Secure context</span> <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>  
Contains the security code of the card used to make the payment.

[`BasicCardResponse.expiryMonth`](basiccardresponse/expirymonth) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span> <span class="notecard inline secure">Secure context</span> <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>  
Contains the expiry month of the card used to make the payment.

[`BasicCardResponse.expiryYear`](basiccardresponse/expiryyear) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span> <span class="notecard inline secure">Secure context</span> <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>  
Contains the expiry year of the card used to make the payment.

[`BasicCardResponse.billingAddress`](basiccardresponse/billingaddress) <span class="badge inline readonly">Read only </span> <span class="notecard inline secure">Secure context</span> <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>  
Contains the billing address of the card used to make the payment.

## Examples

In the following example, the [`PaymentRequest()`](paymentrequest/paymentrequest) constructor is used to create a new payment request, which takes three objects as parameters — one containing details of the payment methods that can be used for the payment, one containing details of the actual order (such as items bought and shipping options), and an optional object containing further options.

The first of these three (`supportedInstruments` in the example below) contains a `data` property that has to conform to the structure defined by the [`BasicCardRequest`](basiccardrequest) dictionary.

    var supportedInstruments = [{
      supportedMethods: 'basic-card',
      data: {
        supportedNetworks: ['visa', 'mastercard', 'amex', 'jcb',
                            'diners', 'discover', 'mir', 'unionpay'],
        supportedTypes: ['credit', 'debit']
      }
    }];

    var details = {
      total: {label: 'Donation', amount: {currency: 'USD', value: '65.00'}},
      displayItems: [
        {
          label: 'Original donation amount',
          amount: {currency: 'USD', value: '65.00'}
        }
      ],
      shippingOptions: [
        {
          id: 'standard',
          label: 'Standard shipping',
          amount: {currency: 'USD', value: '0.00'},
          selected: true
        }
      ]
    };

    var options = {requestShipping: true};

    try {
      var request = new PaymentRequest(supportedInstruments, details, options);
      // Add event listeners here.
      // Call show() to trigger the browser's payment flow.
      request.show().then(function(instrumentResponse) {
        // Do something with the response from the UI.
      })
      .catch(function(err) {
        // Do something with the error from request.show().
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Catch any other errors.
    }

Once the payment flow has been triggered using [`PaymentRequest.show()`](paymentrequest/show) and the promise resolves successfully, the [`PaymentResponse`](paymentresponse) object available inside the fulfilled promise (`instrumentResponse` above) will have a [`PaymentResponse.details`](paymentresponse/details) property that will contain response details. This has to conform to the structure defined by the `BasicCardResponse` dictionary, and may look something like this:

    {
      "cardNumber' : '9999999999999999",
      "cardholderName' : 'Mr. Dick Straw",
      "cardSecurityCode" : "999",
      "expiryMonth" : "07",
      "expiryYear" : "2021",
      "billingAddress" : {
        "country" : "GB",
        // etc. billing address is a PaymentAddress object
      }
    }
