PositionSensorVRDevice.getState()
=================================

**Deprecated**

This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

**Experimental**

**This is an [experimental technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental)**  
Check the [Browser compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) carefully before using this in production.

The `getState()` method of the [`PositionSensorVRDevice`](../positionsensorvrdevice) interface returns the current state of the position sensor for the current frame (e.g. within the current [`window.requestAnimationFrame`](../window/requestanimationframe) callback) or for the previous frame, contained with a [`VRPose`](../vrpose) object. This is the method you'd normally want to use, vs. [`PositionSensorVRDevice.getImmediateState`](getimmediatestate).

Syntax
------

    var myPositionState = PositionSensorVRDevice.getState();

### Parameters

None.

### Returns

A [`VRPose`](../vrpose) object.

Examples
--------

The following example is taken from our [positionsensorvrdevice](https://mdn.github.io/webvr-tests/positionsensorvrdevice/) demo, which uses the WebVR API to update the view of a simple [`2D canvas`](../canvasrenderingcontext2d) scene on each frame of a [`requestAnimationFrame`](../window/requestanimationframe) loop.

    function setView() {
      var posState = gPositionSensor.getState();
      if(posState.hasPosition) {
        posPara.textContent = 'Position: x' + roundToTwo(posState.position.x) + " y"
                                    + roundToTwo(posState.position.y) + " z"
                                    + roundToTwo(posState.position.z);
        xPos = -posState.position.x * WIDTH * 2;
        yPos = posState.position.y * HEIGHT * 2;
        if(-posState.position.z > 0.01) {
          zPos = -posState.position.z;
        } else {
          zPos = 0.01;
        }
      }

      if(posState.hasOrientation) {
        orientPara.textContent = 'Orientation: x' + roundToTwo(posState.orientation.x) + " y"
                                    + roundToTwo(posState.orientation.y) + " z"
                                    + roundToTwo(posState.orientation.z);
        xOrient = posState.orientation.x * WIDTH;
        yOrient = -posState.orientation.y * HEIGHT * 2;
        zOrient = posState.orientation.z * 180;

      }
    }

Here we are grabbing a [`VRPose`](../vrpose) object using `getState()` and storing it in `posState`. We then check to make sure that position and orientation info is present in the current frame using [`VRPose.hasPosition`](../vrpose/hasposition) and [`VRPose.hasOrientation`](../vrpose/hasorientation) (these return `null` if, for example the head mounted display is turned off or not pointing at the position sensor, which would cause an error.)

We then output the x, y and z position and orientation values for informational purposes, and use those values to update the `xPos`, `yPos`, `zPos, ``xOrient`, `yOrient`, and `zOrient` variables, which are used to update the scene rendering on each frame.

The support for this feature is currently disabled by default in Firefox. To enable WebVR support in Firefox Nightly/Developer Edition, you can go to `about:config` and enable the `dom.vr*` prefs. A better option however is to install the [WebVR Enabler Add-on](http://www.mozvr.com/downloads/webvr-addon-0.1.0.xpi), which does this for you and sets up other necessary parts of the [environment](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API/WebVR_environment_setup)
