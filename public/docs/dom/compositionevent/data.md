# CompositionEvent.data

The `data` read-only property of the [`CompositionEvent`](../compositionevent) interface returns the characters generated by the input method that raised the event; its exact nature varies depending on the type of event that generated the `CompositionEvent` object.

## Syntax

     myData = compositionEvent.data

### Value

A [`DOMString`](../domstring) representing the event data:

- For `compositionstart` events, this is the currently selected text that will be replaced by the string being composed. This value doesn't change even if content changes the selection range; rather, it indicates the string that was selected when composition started.
- For `compositionupdate`, this is the string as it stands currently as editing is ongoing.
- For `compositionend` events, this is the string as committed to the editor.
