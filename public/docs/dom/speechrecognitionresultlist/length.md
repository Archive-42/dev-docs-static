SpeechRecognitionResultList.length
==================================

**Experimental**

**This is an [experimental technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental)**  
Check the [Browser compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) carefully before using this in production.

The `length` read-only property of the [`SpeechRecognitionResultList`](../speechrecognitionresultlist) interface returns the length of the "array" — the number of [`SpeechRecognitionResult`](../speechrecognitionresult) objects in the list.

Syntax
------

    var myLength = speechRecognitionResultListInstance.length;

### Returns

A number.

Examples
--------

This code is excerpted from our [Speech color changer](https://github.com/mdn/web-speech-api/blob/master/speech-color-changer/script.js) example.

    recognition.onresult = function(event) {
      // The SpeechRecognitionEvent results property returns a SpeechRecognitionResultList object
      // The SpeechRecognitionResultList object contains SpeechRecognitionResult objects.
      // It has a getter so it can be accessed like an array
      // The first [0] returns the SpeechRecognitionResult at position 0.
      // Each SpeechRecognitionResult object contains SpeechRecognitionAlternative objects that contain individual results.
      // These also have getters so they can be accessed like arrays.
      // The second [0] returns the SpeechRecognitionAlternative at position 0.
      // We then return the transcript property of the SpeechRecognitionAlternative object
      var color = event.results[0][0].transcript;
      diagnostic.textContent = 'Result received: ' + color + '.';
      bg.style.backgroundColor = color;

      console.log(event.results.length);
    }

### Firefox OS permissions

To use speech recognition in an app, you need to specify the following permissions in your [manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Build/Manifest):

    "permissions": {
      "audio-capture" : {
        "description" : "Audio capture"
      },
      "speech-recognition" : {
        "description" : "Speech recognition"
      }
    }

You also need a privileged app, so you need to include this as well:

      "type": "privileged"
