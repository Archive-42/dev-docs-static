MouseEvent.WEBKIT\_FORCE\_AT\_MOUSE\_DOWN
=========================================

**Non-standard**

This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

`MouseEvent.WEBKIT_FORCE_AT_MOUSE_DOWN` is a proprietary, WebKit-specific, static numeric property whose value is the minimum force necessary for a normal click.

Because `WEBKIT_FORCE_AT_MOUSE_DOWN` is a static property of `MouseEvent`, you always use it as `MouseEvent.WEBKIT_FORCE_AT_MOUSE_DOWN`, rather than as a property of a `MouseEvent` instance.
