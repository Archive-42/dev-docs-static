# msPlayToDisabled

**Non-standard**

This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

`msPlayToDisabled` is a read/write property which gets and sets if the _PlayTo_ device is enabled or disabled.

This proprietary property is specific to Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.

## Syntax

## Value

Boolean value set to _true_ indicates that the _PlayTo_ device is disabled.

The `msPlayToDisabled` attribute extends the `HTMLEmbedElement`, `HTMLImageElement`, `HTMLMediaElement`, and `HTMLObject` interfaces.
