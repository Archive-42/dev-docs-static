# MediaTrackConstraints.height

The [`MediaTrackConstraints`](../mediatrackconstraints) dictionary's `height` property is a [`ConstrainULong`](../constrainulong) describing the requested or mandatory constraints placed upon the value of the [`height`](../mediatracksettings/height) constrainable property.

If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported by checking the value of [`MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.height`](../mediatracksupportedconstraints/height) as returned by a call to [`MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()`](../mediadevices/getsupportedconstraints). However, typically this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any constraints they're unfamiliar with.

## Syntax

    var constraintsObject = { height: constraint };

    constraintsObject.height = constraint;

### Value

If this value is a number, the user agent will attempt to obtain media whose height is as close as possible to this number given the capabilities of the hardware and the other constraints specified. Otherwise, the value of this [`ConstrainULong`](../constrainulong) will guide the user agent in its efforts to provide an exact match to the required height (if `exact` is specified or both `min` and `max` are provided and have the same value) or to a best-possible value.

## Example

See [Example: Constraint exerciser](#) in [Capabilities, constraints, and settings](../media_streams_api/constraints) for an example.
