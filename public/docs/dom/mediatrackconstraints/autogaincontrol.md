# MediaTrackConstraints.autoGainControl

The [`MediaTrackConstraints`](../mediatrackconstraints) dictionary's `autoGainControl` property is a [`ConstrainBoolean`](../constrainboolean) describing the requested or mandatory constraints placed upon the value of the [`autoGainControl`](../mediatracksettings/autogaincontrol) constrainable property.

If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported by checking the value of [`MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.autoGainControl`](../mediatracksupportedconstraints/autogaincontrol) as returned by a call to [`MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()`](../mediadevices/getsupportedconstraints). However, typically this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any constraints they're unfamiliar with.

Automatic gain control is typically a feature provided by microphones, although it can be provided by other input sources as well.

## Syntax

    var constraintsObject = { autoGainControl: constraint };

    constraintsObject.autoGainControl = constraint;

### Value

If this value is a simple `true` or `false`, the user agent will attempt to obtain media with automatic gain control enabled or disabled as specified, if possible, but will not fail if this can't be done. If, instead, the value is given as an object with an `exact` field, that field's Boolean value indicates a required setting for the automatic gain control feature; if it can't be met, then the request will result in an error.

## Example

See [Example: Constraint exerciser](#) in [Capabilities, constraints, and settings](../media_streams_api/constraints) for an example.
