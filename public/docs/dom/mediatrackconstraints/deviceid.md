MediaTrackConstraints.deviceId
==============================

The [`MediaTrackConstraints`](../mediatrackconstraints) dictionary's `deviceId` property is a [`ConstrainDOMString`](../constraindomstring) describing the requested or mandatory constraints placed upon the value of the [`deviceId`](../mediatracksettings/deviceid) constrainable property.

If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported by checking the value of [`MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.deviceId`](../mediatracksupportedconstraints/deviceid) as returned by a call to [`MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()`](../mediadevices/getsupportedconstraints). However, typically this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any constraints they're unfamiliar with.

Because [RTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTP) doesn't include this information, tracks associated with a [WebRTC](../webrtc_api) [`RTCPeerConnection`](../rtcpeerconnection) will never include this property.

Syntax
------

    var constraintsObject = { deviceId: constraint };

    constraintsObject.deviceId = constraint;

### Value

An object based on [`ConstrainDOMString`](../constraindomstring) specifying one or more acceptable, ideal, and/or exact (mandatory) device IDs which are acceptable as the source of media content.

Device IDs are unique for a given origin, and are guaranteed to be the same across browsing sessions on the same origin. However, the value of the `deviceId` is determined by the source of the track's content, and there's no particular format mandated by the specification (although some kind of GUID is recommended). That means that a given track will only return one value for the `deviceId` when you call [`getCapabilities()`](../mediastreamtrack/getcapabilities).

Because of this, there's no use for the device ID when calling [`MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints()`](../mediastreamtrack/applyconstraints), since there is only one possible value; however, you can record a `deviceId` and use it to ensure that you get the same source for multiple calls to [`getUserMedia()`](../mediadevices/getusermedia).

An exception to the rule that device IDs are the same across browsing sessions: private browsing mode will use a different ID, and will change it each browsing session.

Example
-------

See [Example: Constraint exerciser](#) in [Capabilities, constraints, and settings](../media_streams_api/constraints) for an example.
