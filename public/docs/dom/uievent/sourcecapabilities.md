UIEvent.sourceCapabilities
==========================

**Experimental**

**This is an [experimental technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental)**  
Check the [Browser compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) carefully before using this in production.

The `UIEvent.sourceCapabilities` read-only property returns an instance of the [`InputDeviceCapabilities`](../inputdevicecapabilities) interface which provides information about the physical device responsible for generating a touch event. If no input device was responsible for the event, it returns `null`.

When a single user interaction with an input device generates a series of different input events, the `sourceCapabilities` property for all of them will point to the same instance of `InputDeviceCapabilities`. For example, when a user lifts their finger off of a touchscreen, several UIEvents may be generated including `touchend`, `mousedown`, `click`, and `focus`. All of these events must have the same `sourceCapabilities` representing the touchscreen.

A device is considered "responsible" for an event only when that interaction is part of the abstraction provided by the web platform. For example, many user agents allow a window to be resized with a mouse or a keyboard, but this detail is not exposed to the web platform in any way, and so the sourceCapabilities of a resize event will typically be null.
