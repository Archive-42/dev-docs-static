SpeechRecognition.grammars
==========================

**Experimental**

**This is an [experimental technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental)**  
Check the [Browser compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) carefully before using this in production.

The `grammars` property of the [`SpeechRecognition`](../speechrecognition) interface returns and sets a collection of [`SpeechGrammar`](../speechgrammar) objects that represent the grammars that will be understood by the current `SpeechRecognition`.

Syntax
------

    var myGrammars = mySpeechRecognition.grammars;
    mySpeechRecognition.grammars = mySpeechGrammarList;

### Value

A [`SpeechGrammarList`](../speechgrammarlist) containing the [`SpeechGrammar`](../speechgrammar) objects that represent your grammar for your app.

Examples
--------

This code is excerpted from our [Speech color changer](https://github.com/mdn/web-speech-api/blob/master/speech-color-changer/script.js) example.

    var grammar = '#JSGF V1.0; grammar colors; public <color> = aqua | azure | beige | bisque | black | blue | brown | chocolate | coral | crimson | cyan | fuchsia | ghostwhite | gold | goldenrod | gray | green | indigo | ivory | khaki | lavender | lime | linen | magenta | maroon | moccasin | navy | olive | orange | orchid | peru | pink | plum | purple | red | salmon | sienna | silver | snow | tan | teal | thistle | tomato | turquoise | violet | white | yellow ;'
    var recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
    var speechRecognitionList = new SpeechGrammarList();
    speechRecognitionList.addFromString(grammar, 1);
    recognition.grammars = speechRecognitionList;
    //recognition.continuous = false;
    recognition.lang = 'en-US';
    recognition.interimResults = false;
    recognition.maxAlternatives = 1;

### Firefox OS permissions

To use speech recognition in an app, you need to specify the following permissions in your [manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Build/Manifest):

    "permissions": {
      "audio-capture" : {
        "description" : "Audio capture"
      },
      "speech-recognition" : {
        "description" : "Speech recognition"
      }
    }

You also need a privileged app, so you need to include this as well:

      "type": "privileged"
