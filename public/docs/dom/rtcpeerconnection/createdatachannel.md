RTCPeerConnection.createDataChannel()
=====================================

The `createDataChannel()` method on the [`RTCPeerConnection`](../rtcpeerconnection) interface creates a new channel linked with the remote peer, over which any kind of data may be transmitted. This can be useful for back-channel content such as images, file transfer, text chat, game update packets, and so forth.

If the new data channel is the first one added to the connection, renegotiation is started by delivering a `negotiationneeded` event.

Syntax
------

    dataChannel = RTCPeerConnection.createDataChannel(label[, options]);

### Parameters

`label`  
A human-readable name for the channel. This string may not be longer than 65,535 *bytes*.

 `options` <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>   
An [`RTCDataChannelInit` dictionary](#rtcdatachannelinit_dictionary) providing configuration options for the data channel

### RTCDataChannelInit dictionary

The `RTCDataChannelInit` dictionary provides the following fields, any of which may be included in the object passed as the options parameter in order to configure the data channel to suit your needs:

 `ordered` <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>   
Indicates whether or not messages sent on the [`RTCDataChannel`](../rtcdatachannel) are required to arrive at their destination in the same order in which they were sent (`true`), or if they're allowed to arrive out-of-order (`false`). `true`

**`maxPacketLifeTime` <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>**  
The maximum number of milliseconds that attempts to transfer a message may take in unreliable mode. While this value is a 16-bit unsigned number, each user agent may clamp it to whatever maximum it deems appropriate. `null`

 `maxRetransmits` <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>   
The maximum number of times the user agent should attempt to retransmit a message which fails the first time in unreliable mode. While this value is a16-bit unsigned number, each user agent may clamp it to whatever maximum it deems appropriate. `null`

 `protocol` <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>   
The name of the sub-protocol being used on the [`RTCDataChannel`](../rtcdatachannel), if any; otherwise, the empty string (""). `""` This string may not be longer than 65,535 *bytes*.

 `negotiated` <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>   
By default (`false`), data channels are negotiated in-band, where one side calls `createDataChannel`, and the other side listens to the [`RTCDataChannelEvent`](../rtcdatachannelevent) event using the `ondatachannel` `EventHandler` . Alternatively (`true`), they can be negotiated out of-band, where both sides call `createDataChannel `with an agreed-upon id. `false`

 `id` <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>   
An 16-bit numeric ID for the channel; permitted values are 0-65534. If you don't include this option, the user agent will select an ID for you.

The options which can be configured using the `RTCDataChannelInit` dictionary represent the script-settable subset of the properties on the [`RTCDataChannel`](../rtcdatachannel) interface.

### Return value

A new [`RTCDataChannel`](../rtcdatachannel) object with the specified `label`, configured using the options specified by `options` if that parameter is included; otherwise, the defaults listed above are established.

### Exceptions

`InvalidStateError`  
The [`RTCPeerConnection`](../rtcpeerconnection) is closed.

`TypeError`  
This can happen in a couple of situations:

-   The label and/or protocol string is too long; these cannot be longer than 65,535 bytes (bytes, rather than characters).
-   The `id` is 65535. While this is a valid unsigned 16-bit value, it's not a permitted value for `id`.

`SyntaxError`  
Values were specified for both the `maxPacketLifeTime` and `maxRetransmits` options. You may only specify a non-`null` value for one of these.

`ResourceInUse`  
An `id` was specified, but another [`RTCDataChannel`](../rtcdatachannel) is already using the same value.

`OperationError`  
Either the specified `id` is already in use or, if no `id` was specified, the WebRTC layer was unable to automatically generate an ID because all IDs are in use.

Examples
--------

This example shows how to create a data channel and set up handlers for the `open` and `message` events to send and receive messages on it (For brievity, the example assumes onnegotiationneeded is set up).

    // Offerer side

    var pc = new RTCPeerConnection(options);
    var channel = pc.createDataChannel("chat");
    channel.onopen = function(event) {
      channel.send('Hi you!');
    }
    channel.onmessage = function(event) {
      console.log(event.data);
    }

    // Answerer side

    var pc = new RTCPeerConnection(options);
    pc.ondatachannel = function(event) {
      var channel = event.channel;
        channel.onopen = function(event) {
        channel.send('Hi back!');
      }
      channel.onmessage = function(event) {
        console.log(event.data);
      }
    }

Alternatively, more symmetrical out-of-band negotiation can be used, using an agreed-upon id (0 here):

    // Both sides

    var pc = new RTCPeerConnection(options);
    var channel = pc.createDataChannel("chat", {negotiated: true, id: 0});
    channel.onopen = function(event) {
      channel.send('Hi!');
    }
    channel.onmessage = function(event) {
      console.log(event.data);
    }
