RTCPeerConnection.oniceconnectionstatechange
============================================

**Experimental**

**This is an [experimental technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental)**  
Check the [Browser compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) carefully before using this in production.

The `RTCPeerConnection.oniceconnectionstatechange` property is an event handler which specifies a function to be called when the `iceconnectionstatechange` event is fired on an [`RTCPeerConnection`](../rtcpeerconnection) instance. This happens when the state of the connection's ICE agent, as represented by the [`iceConnectionState`](iceconnectionstate) property, changes.

Syntax
------

    RTCPeerConnection.oniceconnectionstatechange = eventHandler;

### Value

This event handler can be set to function which is passed a single input parameter: an [`Event`](../event) object describing the `iceconnectionstatechange` event which occurred. Your code can look at the value of [`RTCPeerConnection.iceConnectionState`](iceconnectionstate) to determine what the new state is.

Example
-------

The example below watches the state of the ICE agent for a failure or unexpected closure and takes appropriate action, such as presenting an error message or attempting to restart the ICE agent.

    pc.oniceconnectionstatechange = function(event) {
      if (pc.iceConnectionState === "failed" ||
          pc.iceConnectionState === "disconnected" ||
          pc.iceConnectionState === "closed") {
        // Handle the failure
      }
    };

Of course, "disconnected" and "closed" don't necessarily indicate errors; these can be the result of normal ICE negotiation, so be sure to handle these properly (if at all).
