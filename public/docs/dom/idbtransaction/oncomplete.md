# IDBTransaction.oncomplete

The `oncomplete` event handler of the [`IDBTransaction`](../idbtransaction) interface handles the complete event, fired when the transaction successfully completes.

As of Firefox 40, IndexedDB transactions have relaxed durability guarantees to increase performance (see [bug 1112702](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1112702)), which is the same behavior as other IndexedDB-supporting browsers. Previously in a `readwrite` transaction [`IDBTransaction.oncomplete`](oncomplete) was fired only when all data was guaranteed to have been flushed to disk. In Firefox 40+ the `complete` event is fired after the OS has been told to write the data but potentially before that data has actually been flushed to disk. The `complete` event may thus be delivered quicker than before, however, there exists a small chance that the entire transaction will be lost if the OS crashes or there is a loss of system power before the data is flushed to disk.

**Note:** This feature is available in [Web Workers](../web_workers_api).

**Note**: In Firefox, if you wish to ensure durability for some reason (e.g. you're storing critical data that cannot be recomputed later) you can force a transaction to flush to disk before delivering the `complete` event by creating a transaction using the experimental (non-standard) `readwriteflush` mode (see [`IDBDatabase.transaction`](../idbdatabase/transaction).) This is currently experimental, and can only be used if the `dom.indexedDB.experimental` pref is set to `true` in `about:config`.

## Syntax

    transaction.oncomplete = function(event) { ... };

## Example

In the following code snippet, we open a read/write transaction on our database and add some data to an object store. Note also the functions attached to transaction event handlers to report on the outcome of the transaction opening in the event of success or failure. Note the `transaction.oncomplete = function(event) { };` block, which reports back when the transaction was successful. For a full working example, see our [To-do Notifications](https://github.com/mdn/to-do-notifications/)<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> app (</span>[view example live](https://mdn.github.io/to-do-notifications/)<span style="line-height: 1.5;">.)</span>

    // Let us open our database
    var DBOpenRequest = window.indexedDB.open("toDoList", 4);

    DBOpenRequest.onsuccess = function(event) {
      note.innerHTML += '<li>Database initialised.</li>';

      // store the result of opening the database in the db variable.
      // This is used a lot below
      db = DBOpenRequest.result;

      // Run the addData() function to add the data to the database
      addData();
    };

    function addData() {
      // Create a new object ready for being inserted into the IDB
      var newItem = [ { taskTitle: "Walk dog", hours: 19, minutes: 30, day: 24, month: "December", year: 2013, notified: "no" } ];

      // open a read/write db transaction, ready for adding the data
      var transaction = db.transaction(["toDoList"], "readwrite");

      // report on the success of opening the transaction
      transaction.oncomplete = function(event) {
        note.innerHTML += '<li>Transaction completed: database modification finished.</li>';
      };

      transaction.onerror = function(event) {
        note.innerHTML += '<li>Transaction not opened due to error: ' + transaction.error + '</li>';
      };

      // create an object store on the transaction
      var objectStore = transaction.objectStore("toDoList");

      // add our newItem object to the object store
      var objectStoreRequest = objectStore.add(newItem[0]);

      objectStoreRequest.onsuccess = function(event) {
        // report the success of the request (this does not mean the item
        // has been stored successfully in the DB - for that you need transaction.oncomplete)
        note.innerHTML += '<li>Request successful.</li>';
      };
    };
