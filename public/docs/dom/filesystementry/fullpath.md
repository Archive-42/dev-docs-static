FileSystemEntry.fullPath
========================

**Experimental**

**This is an [experimental technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental)**  
Check the [Browser compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) carefully before using this in production.

The read-only `fullPath` property of the [`FileSystemEntry`](../filesystementry) interface returns a [`USVString`](../usvstring) specifying the full, absolute path from the file system's root to the file represented by the entry.

This can also be thought of as a path which is relative to the root directory, with a "/" prepended to it to make it absolute.

Syntax
------

    var fullPath = FileSystemEntry.fullPath;

### Value

A [`USVString`](../usvstring) indicating the entry's full path.

Example
-------

This example shows a function which is called with a file system; it then gets a [`FileSystemFileEntry`](../filesystemfileentry) for a file named `data.json` and returns its full path.

    function gotFileSystem(fs) {
      let path = "";

      fs.root.getFile("data.json", { create: true, exclusive: true }, function(entry) {
        path = fullPath;
      }, handleError(error));

      return path;
    }

Obviously, this is somewhat contrived, since we know that the file's full path is `"/data.json"`, having just looked it up ourselves, but the concept holds up for scenarios in which you don't know it.
