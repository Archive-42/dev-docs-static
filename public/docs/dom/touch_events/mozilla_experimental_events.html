<h1>Touch events (Mozilla experimental)</h1>
<div class="notecard warning"> <strong id="warning">Warning</strong> <p>This experimental API was removed in Gecko 18.0 (Firefox 18.0 / Thunderbird 18.0 / SeaMonkey 2.15), when support for the standard touch events was implemented.</p> </div> <p>The experimental touch events API described on this page was available from Gecko 2.0 (Firefox 4 / Thunderbird 3.3 / SeaMonkey 2.1) to Gecko/Firefox 17. You should instead use the <a href="../touch_events">standard touch events API</a>, supported since Gecko/Firefox 6 with multi-touch support added in Gecko/Firefox 12.</p> <p>This API allowed you to track the movement of the user's finger on a touch screen, monitoring the raw touch events generated by the system. Although touch events were based on — and work similarly to — mouse events, each event included an identifier that allowed you to track multiple fingers moving on the screen at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="event_fields">Event fields</h2>
<p>Touch events were based upon <a href="../mouseevent"><code>MouseEvent</code></a>, and thereby shared all mouse event fields. They included one additional field.</p> <dl> <dt> streamId</dt> <dd> A unique integer identifying the finger generating the event. When the <code>MozTouchDown</code> event is built, a unique value is assigned to that finger. Corresponding <code>MozTouchMove</code> and <code>MozTouchUp</code> events for that finger will have the same streamId value. This lets you track each finger's movements on the touch screen independently. The stream ID is unique until the <code>MozTouchUp</code> event occurs; after that, the value may be recycled for another series of events.</dd> </dl>
<h2 id="types_of_touch_events">Types of touch events</h2>
<dl> <dt> MozTouchDown</dt> <dd> Sent when the user begins a screen touch action.</dd> <dt> MozTouchMove</dt> <dd> Sent when the user moves his finger on the touch screen.</dd> <dt> MozTouchUp</dt> <dd> Sent when the user lifts his finger off the screen.</dd> </dl>
