# FileReader.readyState

The [`FileReader`](../filereader) `readyState` property provides the current state of the reading operation a `FileReader` is in. A `FileReader` exists in one of the following states:

Value

State

Description

`0`

`EMPTY`

Reader has been created. None of the read methods called yet.

`1`

`LOADING`

A read method has been called.

`2`

`DONE`

The operation is complete.

`EMPTY`  
The `FileReader` has been created, but no readAs method was called yet.

`LOADING`  
A readAs method was invoked. A [`File`](../file) or [`Blob`](../blob) is being read, and no error has occurred yet.

`DONE`  
The read operation is complete. This could mean that: the entire [`File`](../file) or [`Blob`](../blob) has been read into memory, a file read error occurred, or [`abort()`](abort) was called and the read was cancelled.

## Example

    var reader = new FileReader();
    console.log('EMPTY', reader.readyState); // readyState will be 0

    reader.readAsText(blob);
    console.log('LOADING', reader.readyState); // readyState will be 1

    reader.onloadend = function () {
      console.log('DONE', reader.readyState); // readyState will be 2
    };

## Value

A number which is one of the three possible state constants define for the [`FileReader`](../filereader) API.
