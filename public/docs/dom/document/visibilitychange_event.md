# Document: visibilitychange event

The `visibilitychange` event is fired at the document when the contents of its tab have become visible or have been hidden.

## Usage notes

The event doesn't include the document's updated visibility status, but you can get that information from the document's [`visibilityState`](visibilitystate) property.

This event fires with a `visibilityState` of `hidden` when a user navigates to a new page, switches tabs, closes the tab, minimizes or closes the browser, or, on mobile, switches from the browser to a different app. Transitioning to `hidden` is the last event that's reliably observable by the page, so developers should treat it as the likely end of the user's session (for example, for [sending analytics data](../navigator/sendbeacon)).

The transition to `hidden` is also a good point at which pages can stop making UI updates and stop any tasks that the user doesn't want to have running in the background.

## Examples

### Pausing music on transitioning to hidden

This example begins playing a music track when the document becomes visible, and pauses the music when the document is no longer visible.

    document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", function() {
      if (document.visibilityState === 'visible') {
        backgroundMusic.play();
      } else {
        backgroundMusic.pause();
      }
    });

### Sending end-of-session analytics on transitioning to hidden

This example treats the transition to `hidden` as the end of the user's session, and sends the appropriate analytics using the [`Navigator.sendBeacon()`](../navigator/sendbeacon) API:

    document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', function logData() {
      if (document.visibilityState === 'hidden') {
        navigator.sendBeacon('/log', analyticsData);
      }
    });
