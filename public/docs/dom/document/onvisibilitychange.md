# Document.onvisibilitychange

The `Document.onvisibilitychange` property represents the event handler that is called when a `visibilitychange` event reaches this object.

Safari doesnâ€™t fire the `visibilitychange` event as expected when `visibilityState` transitions to `hidden`; so for that case, you need to also include code to listen for the `pagehide` event.

## Syntax

    obj.onvisibilitychange = function;

- `function` is the name of a user-defined function, without the () suffix or any parameters, or an anonymous function declaration.

## Example

    document.onvisibilitychange = function() {
      console.log("Visibility of page has changed!");
    };
