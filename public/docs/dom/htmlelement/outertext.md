# HTMLElement.outerText

**Non-standard**

This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

`HTMLElement.outerText` is a non-standard property. As a getter, it returns the same value as [`HTMLElement.innerText`](innertext). As a setter, it removes the current node and replaces it with the given text.
