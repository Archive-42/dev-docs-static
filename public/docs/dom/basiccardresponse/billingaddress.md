The `billingAddress` property of the [`BasicCardResponse`](../basiccardresponse) dictionary contains the billing address of the card used to make the payment.

## Syntax

    "billingAddress" : PaymentAddress

### Value

A [`PaymentAddress`](../paymentaddress) object representing the billing address of the card.

## Example

Let's look at a sample payment request:

    var request = new PaymentRequest(supportedInstruments, details, options);

    // Call show() to trigger the browser's payment flow.
    request.show().then(function(instrumentResponse) {
      // Do something with the response from the UI.
      console.log(instrumentResponse.details);
    })
    .catch(function(err) {
      // Do something with the error from request.show().
    });

Once the payment flow has been triggered using [`PaymentRequest.show()`](../paymentrequest/show) and the promise resolves successfully, the [`PaymentResponse`](../paymentresponse) object available inside the fulfilled promise (`instrumentResponse` above) will have a <span class="page-not-created">`PaymentResponse.details`</span> property that will contain response details. This has to conform to the structure defined by the `BasicCardResponse` dictionary, and may look something like this:

    {
      "cardNumber' : '9999999999999999",
      "cardholderName' : 'Mr. Dick Straw",
      "cardSecurityCode" : "999",
      "expiryMonth" : "07",
      "expiryYear" : "2021",
      "billingAddress" : {
        "country" : "GB",
        // etc. billing address is a PaymentAddress object
      }
    }
