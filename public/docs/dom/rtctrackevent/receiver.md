RTCTrackEvent.receiver
======================

The read-only `receiver` property of the [`RTCTrackEvent`](../rtctrackevent) interface indicates the [`RTCRtpReceiver`](../rtcrtpreceiver) which is used to receive data containing media for the [`track`](track) to which the event refers.

Syntax
------

    var rtpReceiver = trackEvent.receiver;

### Value

The [`RTCRtpTransceiver`](../rtcrtptransceiver) which pairs the `receiver` with a sender and other properties which establish a single bidirectional [SRTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTP) stream for use by the [`track`](track) associated with the `RTCTrackEvent`.

**Note:** The [`transceiver`](transceiver) includes its own [`receiver`](../rtcrtptransceiver/receiver) property, which will always be the same [`RTCRtpReceiver`](../rtcrtpreceiver) as this one.
