ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.skipWaiting()
======================================

The `ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.skipWaiting()` method of the [`ServiceWorkerGlobalScope`](../serviceworkerglobalscope) forces the waiting service worker to become the active service worker.

Use this method with [`Clients.claim()`](../clients/claim) to ensure that updates to the underlying service worker take effect immediately for both the current client and all other active clients.

Syntax
------

    ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.skipWaiting().then(function() {
      //Do something
    });

### Returns

A [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that immediately resolves with `undefined`.

Example
-------

While `self.skipWaiting()` can be called at any point during the service worker's execution, it will only have an effect if there's a newly installed service worker that might otherwise remain in the `waiting` state. Therefore, it's common to call `self.skipWaiting()` from inside of an [`InstallEvent`](../installevent) handler.

The following example causes a newly installed service worker to progress into the `activating` state, regardless of whether there is already an active service worker.

    self.addEventListener('install', function(event) {
      // The promise that skipWaiting() returns can be safely ignored.
      self.skipWaiting();

      // Perform any other actions required for your
      // service worker to install, potentially inside
      // of event.waitUntil();
    });
