# PromiseRejectionEvent()

The `PromiseRejectionEvent()` constructor returns a newly created [`PromiseRejectionEvent`](../promiserejectionevent), which represents events fired when a JavaScript [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) is rejected. With promise rejection events, it becomes possible to detect and report promises which fail and whose failures go unnoticed. It also becomes easier to write a global handler for errors.

There are two types of `PromiseRejectionEvent`: `unhandledrejection` is sent by the JavaScript runtime when a promise is rejected but the rejection goes unhandled. A `rejectionhandled` event is emitted if a promise is rejected but the rejection is caught by a rejection handler..

## Syntax

    promiseRejectionEvent = PromiseRejectionEvent(type, options);

### Parameters

_The `PromiseRejectionEvent()` constructor also inherits parameters from [`Event()`](../event/event)._

`type`  
A string representing the name of the type of the `PromiseRejectionEvent`. This is case-sensitive and should be one of `"rejectionhandled"` or `"unhandledrejection"`, to match the event names of the possible (non-synthetic) [`PromiseRejectionEvent`](../promiserejectionevent) events that user agents can actually fire).

`options`  
An [`Object`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) specifying details about the rejection which occurred:

`promise`  
The [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that was rejected.

`reason`  
Any value or [`Object`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) which represents the reason the promise was rejected. This can be anything from a numeric error code to an error [`DOMString`](../domstring) to an object which contains detailed information describing the situation resulting in the promise being rejected.

### Return value

A new `PromiseRejectionEvent` configured as specified by the parameters.

## Examples

This example creates a new `unhandledrejection` event for the promise `myPromise` with the reason being the string "My house is on fire". The `reason` could just as easily be a number, or even an object with detailed information including the home address, how serious the fire is, and the phone number of an emergency contact who should be notified.

    let myRejectionEvent = new PromiseRejectionEvent("unhandledrejection", {
      promise : myPromise,
      reason : "My house is on fire"
    });
