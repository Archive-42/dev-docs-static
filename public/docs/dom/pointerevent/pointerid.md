# PointerEvent.pointerId

The `pointerId` read-only property of the [`PointerEvent`](../pointerevent) interface is an identifier assigned to a given pointer event. The identifier is unique, being different from the identifiers of all other active pointer events. Since the value may be randomly generated, it is not guaranteed to convey any particular meaning.

## Syntax

    var id = pointerEvent.pointerId;

### Return value

`id`  
The pointer event's unique identifier number.

## Example

The following code snippet compares a previously saved `pointerId` with the one of the `pointerdown` event that was just fired.

    let id; // Let's assume that this is a previously saved pointerId

    target.addEventListener('pointerdown', function(event) {
      // Compare previous event's ID that was cached
      // to current event's ID and handle accordingly
      if (id === event.pointerId) process_event(event);
    }, false);
