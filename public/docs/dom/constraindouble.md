# ConstrainDouble

The `ConstrainDouble` type is used to specify a constraint for a property whose value is a double-precision floating-point number. It extends the [`DoubleRange`](doublerange) dictionary (which provides the ability to specify a permitted range of property values) to also support an exact value and/or an ideal value the property should take on. Additionally, you can specify the property's value as a simple floating-point value, in which case the user agent does its best to match the value once all other more stringent constraints are met.

## Properties

_If the value of a `ConstrainDouble` is an object rather than a number, it may have the properties below in addition the properties it inherits from [`DoubleRange`](doublerange)._

`exact`  
A double-precision floating-point number specifying a specific, required, value the property must have to be considered acceptable.

`ideal`  
A double-precision floating-point number specifying a value the property would ideally have, but which can be considered optional if necessary to find a match.

Technically, `ConstrainDouble` is actually based on an intermediary dictionary named `ConstrainDoubleRange`, which adds `exact` and `ideal` to [`DoubleRange`](doublerange), with `ConstrainDouble` being a type that can be either a long integer or a `DoubleRange`. However, for the sake of documentation clarity, the intermediate type (present only because of quirks in [WebIDL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebIDL) syntax) is ignored here.
